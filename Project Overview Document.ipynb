    "## Project Overview:\n",
    "The rapid advancement of Large Language Models (LLMs) has led to their widespread adoption in enterprise applications, including customer support, content generation, and data analysis. However, general-purpose LLMs often lack domain-specific knowledge and may not meet the specialized needs of enterprises. \n",
    "\n",
    "This project aims to equip students with hands-on experience in fine-tuning LLMs to improve their performance for targeted enterprise use cases. Utilizing techniques such as Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), students will develop custom datasets and leverage open-source tools from GitHub (e.g., Unsloth) to fine-tune a model. By evaluating performance improvements post-fine-tuning, students will demonstrate the effectiveness of their approach and contribute to the growing field of AI customization for businesses.\n",
