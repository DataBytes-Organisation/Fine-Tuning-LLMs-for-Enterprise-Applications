## Project 1 Fine-tuning LLMs for Enterprise applications

### Overview, Goals, and Objectives

This project centers on enhancing the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) for enterprise use through advanced fine-tuning strategies. Although general-purpose LLMs exhibit impressive capabilities, they frequently lack the precise, domain-specific knowledge required for specialized tasks in fields like healthcare, finance, customer service, and content creation.

By applying Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT) and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), the project will refine pre-trained LLMs to boost efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability for targeted business functions. This includes assembling domain-specific datasets, using open-source tools (e.g., Unsloth), and methodically assessing performance improvements. The ultimate aim is to deliver scalable, resource-efficient fine-tuning techniques that enable organizations to deploy custom AI solutions successfully.

### Motivation

Enterprises are increasingly adopting AI solutions, but general LLMs often fall short in addressing the intricate demands of specialized sectors like healthcare, finance, legal services, and customer engagement. Fine-tuning provides a cost-effective route to elevate model accuracy, minimize bias, and enhance adaptability across different industries.

Key motivators behind this project include:

- Bridging domain-specific gaps in LLM capabilities to align with enterprise needs.
- Optimizing model efficiency through lightweight fine-tuning methods like LoRA.
- Improving AI accessibility by offering scalable fine-tuning frameworks for businesses with constrained computational resources.
- Driving open-source AI innovation by refining methodologies, sharing curated datasets, and strengthening model - evaluation procedures.

### Aims for Trimester

The project’s long-range vision is to establish a scalable framework that enables enterprises to fine-tune LLMs effectively. Core objectives include:

- Developing best practices for enterprise-specific LLM customization.
- Building a modular fine-tuning pipeline applicable to diverse industries.
- Ensuring ethical AI usage by addressing biases and enhancing transparency in fine-tuned models.
- Contributing to open-source with curated datasets, refined fine-tuning methods, and evaluation outcomes.
- Fostering AI innovation by equipping researchers, developers, and organizations with the expertise and tools to advance AI solutions.
  Impact on Stakeholders
- Enterprises: Obtain custom, high-performing AI models suited to their specific domains.
- Developers & Data Scientists: Access an efficient fine-tuning pipeline to bolster AI-driven applications.
- Researchers: Further AI adaptation methods by building on the project’s findings.
- AI Community: Gain from open-source datasets, refined methodologies, and proven best practices for domain-specific LLM fine-tuning.
