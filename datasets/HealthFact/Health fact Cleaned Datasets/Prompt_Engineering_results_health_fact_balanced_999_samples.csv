2,"Robot prostate surgery has downsides, needs more data","This is a story about a study examining the costs, harms and the impact of doctor experience associated with the use of robotic prostatectomy. The story raised some important issues that are not ordinarily broached during patient – doctor conversations. While raising some potential red flags with respect to doctor experience, the story failed to critically examine what, if any, benefit there might be to this particular surgical approach. While it is valuable to know that after completing 80 procedures of this type, a surgeon is no longer apt to leave cancerous tissue behind, it is also important to know if there is any value added by having this more expensive procedure. The story does serve as an important reminder to consumers that more modern sounding approaches do not necessarily offer the patient a less problem plagued experience. This story is provides an example for consumers to consider about the value in knowing about both the benefits as well as the harms associated with whatever treatment option they are considering. Further – the story raises the point that newer or seemingly more sophisticated treatments are not always superior to lower-tech options.",True,True,True,0.20644807815551758

4,Vegetarian and Mediterranean diet may be equally effective in preventing heart disease,"The subject of the news release is a newly published, randomized, controlled study comparing the effects of a Mediterranean diet and a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet (which excludes meat and fish but allows eggs and dairy) on total body weight, BMI, fat mass, and cholesterol levels. The release clearly outlines the differences in the two diets and makes it clear this is the first head-to-head comparison of these two diets within groups of meat consumers. But the news release falls short in not including many of the study’s limitations, as well as making it clear to readers that the study outcomes are based on surrogate markers that cannot draw direct conclusions about “preventing heart disease” or stroke as implied. According to the CDC, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., with more than  600,000 deaths per year. Dietary patterns are known to affect our risk for heart disease, and represent an opportunity for each of us to modify that risk. What concerns most of us is having the duration or quality of our life affected by a heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular disease. So studies which actually look at hard outcomes like that — rather than surrogate markers such as cholesterol levels measured over just a few months — are more relevant to more people. Furthermore, studies which look at the effect of diet on major diseases like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke aren’t just widespread, but often lead to wide-ranging and wide-reaching news coverage. Such studies usually have significant limitations, debatable outcomes, and are prone to unjustified or hyperbolic language. This places a premium on journalists covering such studies to look for independent viewpoints, and a premium on readers for staying skeptical.",Misleading,False,False,0.20530343055725098

There was no comparison group of people who did not receive the twice-daily injections fed a comparable number of calories following weight loss. No context was given, providing no mention of any other weight loss maintenance methods. The conclusion that this study (of an injected hormone) “suggests that the weight loss solution may eventually be a pill” is totally unsupported by anything in the original research. And it conflicts with a line that appeared just three sentences earlier in the story, which explained, “the lead investigator said the 10-week study was too short and too small to determine whether continuous leptin treatments could allow dieters to keep off their weight permanently and effortlessly.” Finally, the story did not reveal that in the study, subjects were fed a meager 800 calories a day, which is more akin to starvation than to dieting.

A healthy diet and breast cancer risk reduction are worthy topics, but the story doesn’t touch on some important points — such as the fact that a previous study in Pediatrics by the same researchers, using the same cohort data, pointed to adolescent dietary fiber intake as a significant factor in reducing breast cancer risk. We also were confused by the data discussion: What does a 25% reduction actually mean? Without absolute numbers, we’re just not sure. As we noted in our story reviews related to the earlier Pediatrics study, the CDC reports that breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States — with more than 224,000 new cases reported in 2012 alone.

Laudably, the headline and the body of the news release caution that this isn’t a proven treatment. But there’s far more hype here than substance. The news release lauds researchers for quick action and offers a quote about how “exciting” it is that academia and industry “are bringing urgently needed new tests and treatments to patients.” But there’s no mention that Imperial College London has a patent on this drug. There’s also no discussion of how many patients might benefit from this, or acknowledgement of the extremely high prices for new cancer drugs. The high cost of new cancer drugs, some of which offer only marginal benefits, is strangling healthcare budgets around the world even though initial research is often funded by government agencies and charities.

The Guardian appears to lean heavily on an Imperial College press release that trumpets the benefits of taking statin drugs, which can lower LDL or “bad” cholesterol — and reduce the risk of deadly heart disease. It claims the study showed statins reduced the risk of death from heart disease by 28%. But that’s a lopsided and potentially misleading way to present the data. When broken down into absolute numbers, the benefits are far less dramatic (see quantified benefits criterion, below). In that light, the advantages compared to the disadvantages of taking statins for many years — risk of muscle pain, liver damage, diabetes, and more — become less clear. The story also misses a very big red flag when it comes to making clear that most of the authors have a financial relationship with the primary funder of the study: a drug company that makes statins.

The release claims that the new technique “measurably improves upon current prostate imaging,”  is “more reliable” than existing techniques, and “provides a better target for biopsies.” No data are provided to support any of these assertions, and the original study that sparked the release included just 27 patients and should be considered highly preliminary. Even the title of that study calls the results merely a “proof of principle.” [Editor’s note: This review was completed in January while we were still developing and honing this news releases review service. Although it’s a few months old, this review contains valuable information for those who write and consume health-related news releases, which is why we’re still publishing it.] Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in men. However, some prostate tumors, even if malignant, may be slow growing and warrant nothing more than watching. If this new MRI method can help identify low-risk tumors, or assess the likelihood that a tumor will spread beyond the prostate, it would be a useful tool for guiding treatment. But the release doesn’t offer any data to show that this technique performs better than existing assessment approaches, and so its ability to justify a role for this new technology in prostate cancer treatment is extremely limited.",False,True,False,0.2039949893951416

Nonetheless, the story went on to mention many problems that have at one time or other been postulated to be related to folic acid levels. And although the story indicated at the end that the study results did not show that folic acid supplementation was of benefit, the overall gist of the piece was that there was reason to be concerned about the folic acid intake of our nation’s youth.

Some heartburn drugs may be behind an increase in fractures","This is a compact (only 566 words), nicely reported story that places a potentially important development in its appropriate context. The researchers went to great lengths in their published study to weed out variables other than heartburn drugs that might explain the increase in hip fractures that they observed. Nevertheless, they acknowledge that their retrospective review of a large patient database is inherently incapable of proving cause and effect. The quote from Dr. Alan Buchman in the news story summarizes this chief drawback well: The patients, he notes, may “have some other problem that increases the risk of fractures.” The study provides reasonable evidence to support the news article’s recommendations that patients should only use the drugs if they need them, and even then take them only at their lowest beneficial dose. Whether “the solution is to simply consume more calcium” remains unknown, unfortunately. Additional advice on the benefits of lifestyle and dietary changes would have been welcome, and perhaps a note on the relatively lower fracture risk associated with the class known as histamine blockers. In the end, the take home point may be that patients and doctors should periodically question the need to take any medicine used over the long term, even ones thought to be very safe.",True,True,True,0.19864749908447266

72,Minimally invasive treatment reduces knee pain and disability from osteoarthritis,"This release outlines interim results from a small  clinical trial proposing a new treatment — geniculate artery embolization (GAE) — to reduce the pain in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The study was presented at the Society of Interventional Radiology’s annual meeting. The main concerns with this report are the small study size (just 13 patients) and the brief duration of the study. Outcomes include results only through 1 month after the procedure. Almost half of the patients didn’t complete the 1-month follow-up assessment. The study didn’t include a control group. The release also ignored the potential risks of the procedure and its costs. Knee pain from osteoarthritis is a growing problem among the aging population and new approaches to reduce this type of pain could improve the quality of life for many older patients. Any non-opioid or  non-surgical approach which can match the success of knee replacement surgery in resolving pain and improving function would be an advance in caring for people with disabling osteoarthritis of the knee. But this release, and the extremely early stage of this research, goes too far in its claims of benefit.

As we state below in our “Evidence” criterion: “We aren’t told if the symptom improvement is clinically meaningful. After all, IBS is a chronic condition and this is a short-term study. And most importantly, the reporting is confusing: “Changes in quality of life …..were not significantly different…. but all were much improved at the 3-month followup in the meditation group.”  And no explanation was given of how symptom changes were measured. Or what was meant by “all were much improved at the three-month followup.”  That’s a big weakness in the story.”  Many people are interested in non-medical approaches to improving health. Mindfulness meditation and other complemenary and alternative therapies, along with exercise and nutritional recommendations are of high interest.

Particular strengths of the story include:  Terrific interview segments with the lead author and with two urologists. The perspective that some urologists may have once seen a """"financial windfall"""" in the use of hormone therapy, explaining some of the expansion in its use. One weakness:  The story could have (should have?) added the important point that screening for prostate cancer is not proven effective yet and remains controversial. One of the reasons so many elderly men are thrown into this difficult decision-making thicket is that the use of the PSA blood test has led to many men being diagnosed with prostate cancers of unknown significance, and leading many of them to pursue the hormone therapy that they felt rendered benefit without side effects.

However, it provides no data demonstrating that this approach would identify more children at risk than current screening methods based on family history, personal medical history, and a thorough physical exam. Moreover, no attempt is made to balance the story with discussion of the costs and potential harms that frequent use of EKGs would entail. In the end, the story delivered a one-sided view of an issue that demanded a more nuanced treatment.

Though the story mentioned that there are some experts who believe that the test is being overused, there was no direct comment about this to explain why overuse of a test is problematic. The story did mention that the test was for individuals who were at high risk, though it did not explicitly define what would put someone at high risk. The story did not provide insight into the evidence about the impact of coronary artery calcium on the risk of heart disease. It did not present information about the magnitude of benefit that might be attained with this test. Although there was some discussion about whether the test is used too often, there was little mention of the population for whom the test might provide useful insight about an elevated risk. The story failed to mention an estimate of how much an elevated calcium score affects risk, for example, of having a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. There was no discussion about the harms of treatment. This test does expose the patient to a small amount of radiation. It would be suggested that a woman who is pregnant or might be pregnant be sure to discuss this prior to the test. There is a chance that the test might appear positive even though there are no blockages of coronary arteries. As a result, the person might have additional testing that is unnecessary and that carries its own potential risks and side effects. Additionally – there may also be the harm of incidental non-cardiac findings. The story did not put the new test into the context of existing tests.

The story also failed to completely characterize the costs and availability of acupuncture, and didn’t explain that the research team might have a financial incentive to promote the effectiveness of acupuncture. Amblyopia — a condition which causes reduced vision in one eye because the eye and brain are not communicating properly — is a leading cause of vision impairment in children. Treatment is most successful when the condition is identified and addressed at an early age, but older children can also benefit from patching therapy which forces the weaker eye to work harder and communicate more effectively with the brain. Older children may resist wearing an eye patch, however, and it is possible that using a patch will lead to new problems in the better-functioning eye.

The researchers went to great lengths in their published study to weed out variables other than heartburn drugs that might explain the increase in hip fractures that they observed. Nevertheless, they acknowledge that their retrospective review of a large patient database is inherently incapable of proving cause and effect. The quote from Dr. Alan Buchman in the news story summarizes this chief drawback well: The patients, he notes, may “have some other problem that increases the risk of fractures.” The study provides reasonable evidence to support the news article’s recommendations that patients should only use the drugs if they need them, and even then take them only at their lowest beneficial dose. Whether “the solution is to simply consume more calcium” remains unknown, unfortunately. Additional advice on the benefits of lifestyle and dietary changes would have been welcome, and perhaps a note on the relatively lower fracture risk associated with the class known as histamine blockers.

The therapy, called IRAPjoint, consists of withdrawing a patient’s blood, heating it, and then re-injecting it into the painful joint. The theory behind this practice, which has been done for several years in Europe, is that heat increases the number of anti-inflammatory proteins (also called anti-inflammatory cytokines) in the blood, which then combat inflammation at the re-injection site. While increasingly popular with professional athletes (and horses), there is little actual scientific evidence that this treatment works. Anecdotal evidence can be important, and for top athletes whose careers depend on healthy joints, the gamble and steep price tag may be worth it. But for the general public, there is no high-quality scientific literature that shows this as a credible alternative to existing OA treatments. Joint pain can be caused by different conditions. Though not explicitly mentioned in this news release, the treatment discussed, IRAPjoint, is targeted to individuals with joint inflammation due to arthritic disease. This may be due to overuse (such as professional athletes and “weekend warriors”) or simply wear and tear due to aging. Osteoarthritis (OA) affects millions of Americans, and is the most common chronic joint condition. It can be especially debilitating in older patients, many of whom experience constant pain and loss of mobility. A safe, effective treatment that doesn’t involve the use of harsh steroids or constant pain medications would be welcome and improve the quality of life for many. But the release is not clear about just who should get this treatment.

161,The Scan That Saved My Life,"The story about a reporter’s decision to treat a carotid artery blockage exemplifies the powerful strengths and weaknesses of first-person health care reporting. It carries a powerful emotional punch and an apparently happy ending that overwhelms the evidence presented. Numerous psychology studies document the power of “outcome bias,” in which the results of a decision affect beliefs about whether the decision was correct or not. We are very happy that all went well, but it is reasonable to assume this story would have looked very different if had not. There is no mention of the costs of the surgical procedure. Neither is carotid stenting mentioned as an alternative to endarterectomy surgery. Discussion of carotid artery screening of people who do not have symptoms is mixed up with the reporter’s experience with testing done in order to diagnose the cause of symptoms – a somewhat common flaw of conflating diagnostic testing with screening tests. The risk that the surgery could trigger a stroke, including a fatal one, is highlighted, but the risk statistics reported here are lower than those published in major summaries of the evidence. The headline of the story proclaims that a carotid artery scan “Saved My Life.” That may be true, but it is also unknowable. What the best summaries of the evidence conclude is that in cases similar to those of the reporter, surgery to clear a nearly-blocked carotid artery lowers the long-term risk of stroke and death. However, stories on this topic should highlight the fact that the procedure does not actually “save the lives” of most patients. As a systematic review of the evidence by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded, using a statistical analysis known as the number needed to treat (NNT), six patients need to be treated to prevent one stroke or death within five years of the surgery. That means that for five out of six patients, the procedure probably does not alter the outcome: Either they would not have had a stroke or died even without surgery or they still had a stroke or died despite having the surgery. Another important concern with this story is that the reporter uses his own case — where the scan was part of an attempt to track down the cause of his neurological symptoms — to argue for scanning of all older adults, including those who have no symptoms at all. This is a misleading argument since people with blockage severe enough to cause symptoms are likely different in important ways (and more likely to benefit from this scan) than those who don’t display symptoms. While it is certainly reasonable to choose a treatment shown to reduce the risk of stroke and death, it is imperative that stories clearly communicate the difference between screening and diagnosis, and the uncertainty about whether any particular patient will benefit.",False,False,True,0.21179914474487305

This story (along with those from many other news media outlets) should have addressed the glaring disconnect between what is recommended and what doctors and patients actually do. The story used far lower estimates of the number of people likely to be told to start taking drugs than what was contained in an American Heart Association news release. (And the online and video versions of the ABC News stories used very different numbers.) Readers of this story learn that they are more likely to be told they have high blood pressure, but not what that means to them, other than that they will probably hear more lectures about diet and exercise, and maybe get more drug prescriptions. For a good alternative view, see the this New York Times opinion piece. If almost all of the “new” patients with high blood pressure will be simply advised to improve their lifestyle, by doing things like exercising more, eating better and drinking less alcohol, which are things everyone is advised to do, then what has really changed? Any time that medical experts spout the routine lifestyle advice, reporters should press them to explain what is really likely to change for patients.

National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA), which conducts research on driver behavior and traffic safety, estimates that drowsy driving causes at least 100,000 auto crashes each year. This Reuters story describes a recent study that found that exposing sleep-deprived participants to 45 minutes of bright light before putting them into a driving simulator eliminated the simulated car crashes that occurred when those participants were exposed only to dim light. This story was well done–it gives ample space (albeit lower in the text) to the study’s limitations and to the caution of researchers not affiliated with the study that the only proven remedy for sleepiness is…sleep. Ample independent researchers were included, and the measured benefits of the intervention are stated clearly. Sleep deprivation is common among folks who work night shifts, and even among the general public. While societal calls for getting a good 7 to 8 hours’ sleep—still the only proven remedy for the problem—are growing, both the sleep-deprived and their physicians continue to seek ways to manage sleepiness, from caffeine consumption to cars that notice sloppy driving patterns and suggest the driver take a break.

Arterial stiffness is a cause of atherosclerosis, a  thickening and stiffening of the arterial wall, and is related to high blood pressure or hypertension. The release presents many of the necessary caveats, avoids disease mongering and unjustifiable language, and does a nice job describing what the researchers did to reach their conclusions. The release also does readers a service by explaining a relatively complex topic in terms that regular readers (and journalists) can understand. The actual number of people who saw a benefit is missing, though, as is any mention of harms, any mention of other treatments for arterial stiffness, and any mention of how the study was funded or whether there were any conflicts of interest. We gave the release three stars because we felt these were mostly benign omissions. But, in the interest of keeping a high standard for writing strong scientific news releases, we make note of the omissions where they occurred. The benefits of daily supplement vitamins are under more scrutiny than ever because of repeated large scale studies that show minimal if any health effects.

It was at its best when describing why the trial, despite its positive results, provides only preliminary evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for this condition. On the downside, it offered only a vague description of how the researchers assessed the treatment effects in this study, making the discussion of benefits much less meaningful than that provided in the competing coverage from WebMD. The story also failed to completely characterize the costs and availability of acupuncture, and didn’t explain that the research team might have a financial incentive to promote the effectiveness of acupuncture. Amblyopia — a condition which causes reduced vision in one eye because the eye and brain are not communicating properly — is a leading cause of vision impairment in children. Treatment is most successful when the condition is identified and addressed at an early age, but older children can also benefit from patching therapy which forces the weaker eye to work harder and communicate more effectively with the brain. Older children may resist wearing an eye patch, however, and it is possible that using a patch will lead to new problems in the better-functioning eye. This study suggests that acupuncture may be a safe and effective alternative to patching for older children with amblyopia. Now additional research will be needed to confirm whether the benefits of acupuncture are real and sustainable over the long term.",Misleading,True,False,0.20447850227355957

Although the release ably describes some of the reasons the dietary intervention might work and how, it offers no numbers or measurements to support the conclusion that these foods are associated with fewer menopausal symptoms such as fatigue and hot flashes.

227,Stem Cells for Knee Problems? U.S. Doctors Investigate,"The focus of this story seems to be this question: Where do we stand with regard to stem cells helping with wear-and-tear arthritis (osteoarthritis) of the knees? The story does well in giving some background regarding stem cells, and how this is apparently a growing trend. The story would have been strengthened considerably by including the potential harms of treatments, the costs of stem cells vs. conventional therapy and discussing the alternatives more thoroughly. Osteoarthritis of the knee (like lower back pain) is one of the most common, but difficult-to-treat orthopedic ailments in the Western world. Given that we’re living longer, and experiencing historically high levels of obesity, this problem is expected to become even more common. With this will come a growing demand for non-surgical interventions (although injecting stem cells into the knee joint is still invasive). Health claims about stem cells have exploded and include advertised benefits for everything from Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis to erectile dysfunction and blindness. This means journalists have a big opportunity to educate the public regarding what we do know — and what we don’t know — about this emerging technology. Also, it’s important to note that academic medical centers also have been making misleading claims about stem cells–it’s not just private clinics.",Misleading,False,False,0.1984097957611084

229,MICHIGAN ATHLETIC GROUP SAYS CONCUSSION PROGRAM WORKS,"Concussions incurred during sporting events in middle and high schools may have substantial health impacts on young athletes. Recognition of those impacts has grown exponentially in the US, generating earnest efforts to find ways to diagnose possible problems during games, before an athlete returns to the fray and runs the risk of making things worse. A number of companies now market baseline testing products, which usually involve a “baseline” neurological exam at the start of the season. Later, if the athlete is injured during a game, a shorter “sideline” exam can be conducted to compare to the original exam. This AP story reports on a Michigan-based organization that made baseline testing available to schools in order to gather data over the course of a year about the frequency of potential concussions across ages, genders and type of sport. The story does a nice job of summarizing the results of that study but treats the concept of baseline testing uncritically. Can the brief sideline diagnostic efforts in the midst of a game actually detect a problem in the making? It depends on who you “ask.” Baseline testing is currently fashionable in medical circles. The Journal of the American Association (JAMA) has published articles concluding that baseline procedures are valid tests of cognitive function in athletes, a conclusion disputed by articles in other journals. The CDC has a webpage explaining baseline testing that offers details about when to do the tests but with no efficacy critique. And web pages from “The Sports Concussion Institute” tout the testing as evidence-based. But is it? We could find no controlled trials showing that neuropsychological testing improves outcomes after sports-related concussions. And that, in turn, may mean that baseline testing is still a form of expert opinion masquerading as evidence-based science. Since companies are selling baseline testing products, the possibility of industry influence on the conduct of research exists. These details were needed in the to story to present a full picture of what’s at stake. Sports-related head injuries are increasingly implicated in permanent brain damage. Determining their frequency and potential severity while there is still time to treat or, ideally, avoid the problem is critical.",Misleading,True,False,0.2022840976715088

239,The Scan That Saved My Life,"The story about a reporter’s decision to treat a carotid artery blockage exemplifies the powerful strengths and weaknesses of first-person health care reporting. It carries a powerful emotional punch and an apparently happy ending that overwhelms the evidence presented. Numerous psychology studies document the power of “outcome bias,” in which the results of a decision affect beliefs about whether the decision was correct or not. We are very happy that all went well, but it is reasonable to assume this story would have looked very different if had not. There is no mention of the costs of the surgical procedure. Neither is carotid stenting mentioned as an alternative to endarterectomy surgery. Discussion of carotid artery screening of people who do not have symptoms is mixed up with the reporter’s experience with testing done in order to diagnose the cause of symptoms – a somewhat common flaw of conflating diagnostic testing with screening tests. The risk that the surgery could trigger a stroke, including a fatal one, is highlighted, but the risk statistics reported here are lower than those published in major summaries of the evidence. The headline of the story proclaims that a carotid artery scan “Saved My Life.” That may be true, but it is also unknowable. What the best summaries of the evidence conclude is that in cases similar to those of the reporter, surgery to clear a nearly-blocked carotid artery lowers the long-term risk of stroke and death. However, stories on this topic should highlight the fact that the procedure does not actually “save the lives” of most patients. As a systematic review of the evidence by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded, using a statistical analysis known as the number needed to treat (NNT), six patients need to be treated to prevent one stroke or death within five years of the surgery. That means that for five out of six patients, the procedure probably does not alter the outcome: Either they would not have had a stroke or died even without surgery or they still had a stroke or died despite having the surgery. Another important concern with this story is that the reporter uses his own case — where the scan was part of an attempt to track down the cause of his neurological symptoms — to argue for scanning of all older adults, including those who have no symptoms at all. This is a misleading argument since people with blockage severe enough to cause symptoms are likely different in important ways (and more likely to benefit from this scan) than those who don’t display symptoms. While it is certainly reasonable to choose a treatment shown to reduce the risk of stroke and death, it is imperative that stories clearly communicate the difference between screening and diagnosis, and the uncertainty about whether any particular patient will benefit.",False,False,True,0.20183396339416504

However, the story also says that the test is more accurate than existing methods and “boosted patients’ chances of survival,”even though this study was not designed to test either of those claims. The story should have been clearer about how rare this type of cancer is. The participants in this study had a rate of cancer many, many times higher than the general population in the US, which would greatly affect both its effectiveness and its cost. The comment that the cancer “is prevalent” in southern China and Southeast Asia is misleading–it’s more prevalent, but rates are still on the order of 10 to 20 per 100,000. It would have been nice to see more context from an independent source. Stories about medical studies should never proclaim findings that the studies were not designed to produce. This story includes several cautious descriptions of the study as a proof-of-concept and something that provides a “glimpse of evidence” that a blood test might be able to detect at least one rare type of cancer. However, the story states this test is more accurate than existing methods, despite the fact that the study did not directly compare the new test to standard clinical diagnosis. It also claims the test boosted survival, even though again there was no direct comparison to standard care. The relative accuracy and survival claims stick out from the rest of the reporting in a way that suggests they might have been added to juice up the impact of the story.",True,False,False,0.19912052154541016

The drug is thought to target amyloid — protein fragments that aggregate abnormally in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. But the dense technical language of the release prevents most readers from understanding the scale of the improvement reported in patient thinking or behavior during this study. The major drawback of the release is that it didn’t talk about limitations of the sub-group analysis. While exploratory, this sub-group analysis cannot lead one to draw any conclusions about whether the drug “worked,” given that the overall study was negative. The release also did not help readers understand when the drug would be prescribed, in relation to diagnosis, if the drug is approved. Estimates are that more than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive and disabling neurological disorder. This release about a drug that might slow decline or ease symptoms is disappointing. It claims the drug works, but doesn’t make it clear for readers just how well. We aren’t given context for understanding the numbers that are shared.

The release clearly outlines the differences in the two diets and makes it clear this is the first head-to-head comparison of these two diets within groups of meat consumers. But the news release falls short in not including many of the study’s limitations, as well as making it clear to readers that the study outcomes are based on surrogate markers that cannot draw direct conclusions about “preventing heart disease” or stroke as implied. According to the CDC, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., with more than  600,000 deaths per year. Dietary patterns are known to affect our risk for heart disease, and represent an opportunity for each of us to modify that risk. What concerns most of us is having the duration or quality of our life affected by a heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular disease. So studies which actually look at hard outcomes like that — rather than surrogate markers such as cholesterol levels measured over just a few months — are more relevant to more people. Furthermore, studies which look at the effect of diet on major diseases like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke aren’t just widespread, but often lead to wide-ranging and wide-reaching news coverage. Such studies usually have significant limitations, debatable outcomes, and are prone to unjustified or hyperbolic language.

The Guardian appears to lean heavily on an Imperial College press release that trumpets the benefits of taking statin drugs, which can lower LDL or “bad” cholesterol — and reduce the risk of deadly heart disease. It claims the study showed statins reduced the risk of death from heart disease by 28%. But that’s a lopsided and potentially misleading way to present the data. When broken down into absolute numbers, the benefits are far less dramatic (see quantified benefits criterion, below). In that light, the advantages compared to the disadvantages of taking statins for many years — risk of muscle pain, liver damage, diabetes, and more — become less clear.

311,Dabigatran superior to warfarin when anticoagulation is resumed after bleeding,"This news release touts an analysis of Medicare data for 1,500 patients who suffered a major bleeding event while taking anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation. Researchers found that patients who resumed anticoagulants after a hemorrhage had better stroke and mortality rates than those who did not, and those who resumed treatment with a newer drug, dabigatran, had fewer recurrent hemorrhages than those who restarted treatment with the old standby warfarin. The news release lays out relative differences in outcomes but doesn’t include absolute risks and benefits that would convey the true significance of these findings. Nor does it mention the wide cost difference between the two drugs or the fact that prescribing patterns at the time the data were collected may have skewed the findings. Bottom line: this is an observational study, not a controlled clinical trial. It is not appropriate to be making recommendations about one drug or another based on such a study. This study sheds light on the dilemma of whether patients at risk for blood clots should resume taking anticoagulants after a major hemorrhage. Less than half of patients who survived a bleeding incident resumed taking anticoagulant drugs, apparently because their doctors perceived a high risk of recurrent bleeding. But the authors say their finding that the risk of stroke outweighs the risk of recurrent bleeding should encourage clinicians to resume anti-clotting drugs. And while the analysis shows better outcomes with a new drug compared with an old one, the authors acknowledge that finding needs to be validated in other patient groups and with more recent data.

The report’s most significant shortcoming is that it never made clear that there is no good data to support the assumption that the drugs improve cognitive outcomes.

The article does a reasonable job in covering the major points made in the commentary.

328,German doctors declare “cure” in HIV patient,"The quote marks around the word “cure” in the headline were a sign of the cautious approach of this story. Instead of allowing a sense of hyperbole to permeate, as we saw in other coverage of the same study, we were glad to see many of the appropriate caveats included. The story should have been more specific about the enormous hazards of bone marrow transplants and told readers of their high cost. The word cure, even when surrounded by quote marks certainly gets one’s attention. Applied to a story about HIV and AIDS, it is an attention-grabber. Despite the arguable hyperbole on the part of the German researchers, the story is interesting because it adds to the suggestion that the CCR5 mutation may represent an approach to eradication of the virus. This story, like others on the topic, spent a fair amount of time explaining the difficulty in broadly applying stem cell transplants to AIDS patients and leukemia patients and talked with the appropriate experts. It serves as a good lesson, in many ways, for reporters covering studies with limited results and stacked odds of long term success.",True,False,False,0.20161795616149902

The release states that the randomized, controlled trial involved 744 patient volunteers, which suggests good evidence, but the release omits information from the study that would be useful to journalists and the public. It provides no numerical data on the results of the trial, only vague statements, and doesn’t explain any potential harms of the medication. No information is given on where the study was conducted, or information to rule out conflicts of interest. In essence, this release seems more interested in establishing a foothold in what is seen as a growing commercial market than it is in explaining the actual research,   There’s no question that having dry eyes is at least a nuisance and at worst a clinical problem needing a solution, but it is clearly not a disease. Dry eyes can be a side effect of some medications or surgical procedures, a symptom of some diseases, and a condition affecting older individuals.

331,Dabigatran superior to warfarin when anticoagulation is resumed after bleeding,"This news release touts an analysis of Medicare data for 1,500 patients who suffered a major bleeding event while taking anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation. Researchers found that patients who resumed anticoagulants after a hemorrhage had better stroke and mortality rates than those who did not, and those who resumed treatment with a newer drug, dabigatran, had fewer recurrent hemorrhages than those who restarted treatment with the old standby warfarin. The news release lays out relative differences in outcomes but doesn’t include absolute risks and benefits that would convey the true significance of these findings. Nor does it mention the wide cost difference between the two drugs or the fact that prescribing patterns at the time the data were collected may have skewed the findings. Bottom line: this is an observational study, not a controlled clinical trial. It is not appropriate to be making recommendations about one drug or another based on such a study. This study sheds light on the dilemma of whether patients at risk for blood clots should resume taking anticoagulants after a major hemorrhage. Less than half of patients who survived a bleeding incident resumed taking anticoagulant drugs, apparently because their doctors perceived a high risk of recurrent bleeding. But the authors say their finding that the risk of stroke outweighs the risk of recurrent bleeding should encourage clinicians to resume anti-clotting drugs. And while the analysis shows better outcomes with a new drug compared with an old one, the authors acknowledge that finding needs to be validated in other patient groups and with more recent data. In an observational study such as this, one must be very cautious with the conclusions.",False,False,True,0.19890403747558594

346,New treatment offers some hope for an unshakable tremor,"This story describes a recently FDA-approved device to treat essential tremor in patients who have not responded to medication. The ExAblate Neuro, made by Dallas-based InSightec, uses magnetic resonance images taken during the procedure to deliver focused ultrasound that destroys tissue in the thalamus, the part of the brain where tremors are believed to originate. Results of a randomized clinical trial on the device’s safety and efficacy were published this month in the New England Journal of Medicine. The story and accompanying video (seen at right) vividly illustrate rapid symptom improvements, highlighting a 72-year-old woman who says the procedure changed her life by allowing her to “eat like a normal person” and easily perform basic tasks such as signing her name and folding a scarf. This powerful patient anecdote throws the balance off: Imagine how different the story would seem if the video instead showed a patient who had improved, but also was affected by one of the serious adverse effects caused by the treatment. Also, the story needed specific numbers on the measured benefits and harms, along with a discussion of costs and alternative treatment options. Note: We also reviewed the news release that was issued to journalists about this study. While not life threatening, essential tremor can be debilitating, especially affecting people in their advanced years. The ExAblate Neuro, which the FDA calls the first focused ultrasound device to treat essential tremor in patients who have not responded to medication, offers a somewhat less invasive treatment option than traditional surgical approaches. It’s certainly newsworthy. But all of the facts, including long-term efficacy data, are not in.

The release claims that the prep is a more palatable regimen that includes solid food bars and low-volume beverages. Researchers report that by the end of the Stage 2 clinical trial, the regimen was as safe and effective as two currently available colonoscopy prep formulations in cleaning out the colon, and, importantly, participating trial volunteers gave the preparation a high rating. The release did a good job of describing the study and quantifying benefits. The existing preps that the novel formulation was compared against were never mentioned and that seems an important omission. The release also didn’t provide enough details about harms, or a ballpark cost estimate, which it seems reasonable to expect in almost all news releases. The study was presented at the American College of Gastroenterology’s 2016 annual meeting. The standard bowel preparation and prolonged fasting required to ensure a clean viewing field for the gastroentologist is daunting and has been suggested as a limiting factor in acceptance. For those approaching the magic age,  Dave Barry’s 2009 article in the Miami Herald provides a humorous look at this screening procedure. But the reality is that colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and individuals should have a discussion about the benefits and risks of the procedure. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years.

366,MICHIGAN ATHLETIC GROUP SAYS CONCUSSION PROGRAM WORKS,"Concussions incurred during sporting events in middle and high schools may have substantial health impacts on young athletes. Recognition of those impacts has grown exponentially in the US, generating earnest efforts to find ways to diagnose possible problems during games, before an athlete returns to the fray and runs the risk of making things worse. A number of companies now market baseline testing products, which usually involve a “baseline” neurological exam at the start of the season. Later, if the athlete is injured during a game, a shorter “sideline” exam can be conducted to compare to the original exam. This AP story reports on a Michigan-based organization that made baseline testing available to schools in order to gather data over the course of a year about the frequency of potential concussions across ages, genders and type of sport. The story does a nice job of summarizing the results of that study but treats the concept of baseline testing uncritically. Can the brief sideline diagnostic efforts in the midst of a game actually detect a problem in the making? It depends on who you “ask.” Baseline testing is currently fashionable in medical circles. The Journal of the American Association (JAMA) has published articles concluding that baseline procedures are valid tests of cognitive function in athletes, a conclusion disputed by articles in other journals. The CDC has a webpage explaining baseline testing that offers details about when to do the tests but with no efficacy critique. And web pages from “The Sports Concussion Institute” tout the testing as evidence-based. But is it? We could find no controlled trials showing that neuropsychological testing improves outcomes after sports-related concussions. And that, in turn, may mean that baseline testing is still a form of expert opinion masquerading as evidence-based science. Since companies are selling baseline testing products, the possibility of industry influence on the conduct of research exists. These details were needed in the to story to present a full picture of what’s at stake. Sports-related head injuries are increasingly implicated in permanent brain damage.

373,High doses of vitamin D rapidly reduce arterial stiffness,"Getty Images With just a few tweaks, this could have been a stellar release on a small study about the benefits of high doses of vitamin D on arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness is a cause of atherosclerosis, a  thickening and stiffening of the arterial wall, and is related to high blood pressure or hypertension. The release presents many of the necessary caveats, avoids disease mongering and unjustifiable language, and does a nice job describing what the researchers did to reach their conclusions. The release also does readers a service by explaining a relatively complex topic in terms that regular readers (and journalists) can understand. The actual number of people who saw a benefit is missing, though, as is any mention of harms, any mention of other treatments for arterial stiffness, and any mention of how the study was funded or whether there were any conflicts of interest. We gave the release three stars because we felt these were mostly benign omissions.

Particular strengths of the story include:  Terrific interview segments with the lead author and with two urologists. The perspective that some urologists may have once seen a """"financial windfall"""" in the use of hormone therapy, explaining some of the expansion in its use. One weakness:  The story could have (should have?) added the important point that screening for prostate cancer is not proven effective yet and remains controversial. One of the reasons so many elderly men are thrown into this difficult decision-making thicket is that the use of the PSA blood test has led to many men being diagnosed with prostate cancers of unknown significance, and leading many of them to pursue the hormone therapy that they felt rendered benefit without side effects.

386,"Blood Clot Removal Could Help More Stroke Victims, Study Finds","The news story focuses on a recent JAMA article that reports some stroke patients would benefit from surgically removing a blood clot — via a process called endovascular thrombectomy — up to 7.3 hours after stroke symptoms appear. This is a departure from existing guidelines, which say the surgery should only be done within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms. The story does a good job of illustrating how the new research findings may affect the current standard of care for stroke patients–though it should have been clearer about which patients are eligible for this surgery. Also, the story only addresses costs indirectly, and does not address potential risks associated with endovascular thrombectomy nor adequately quantify the potential benefits of the surgical intervention. Strokes are a big deal. According to the CDC, strokes account for 5 percent of deaths in the United States; more than 795,000 people have a stroke each year in the U.S.; and strokes are estimated to cost the U.S. $34 billion each year. Given the number of people affected by strokes — both patients and their loved ones — new research on stroke treatment is big news. This is not only because it may reduce mortality, but because the type and quality of treatment in the hours immediately following the stroke can have an enormous impact on a patient’s independence — affecting the quality of life for both patients and their loved ones. For all of these reasons, it is important for news about stroke treatment to clearly outline potential risks, costs and benefits associated with various treatment options.

391,Silicon Valley Startup Grail Sees Hope for Cancer Blood Test,"This story about a blood test for nasopharyngeal carcinoma focuses on the business angles of the research as much as on the potential health contributions of a new screening test. It clearly reports that there is much work to be done before such a test could be considered for clinical use. It passes along a calculation by the researchers that detecting one case would cost almost $30,000 based on the results of this study. However, the story also says that the test is more accurate than existing methods and “boosted patients’ chances of survival,”even though this study was not designed to test either of those claims. The story should have been clearer about how rare this type of cancer is. The participants in this study had a rate of cancer many, many times higher than the general population in the US, which would greatly affect both its effectiveness and its cost. The comment that the cancer “is prevalent” in southern China and Southeast Asia is misleading–it’s more prevalent, but rates are still on the order of 10 to 20 per 100,000. It would have been nice to see more context from an independent source. Stories about medical studies should never proclaim findings that the studies were not designed to produce. This story includes several cautious descriptions of the study as a proof-of-concept and something that provides a “glimpse of evidence” that a blood test might be able to detect at least one rare type of cancer. However, the story states this test is more accurate than existing methods, despite the fact that the study did not directly compare the new test to standard clinical diagnosis. It also claims the test boosted survival, even though again there was no direct comparison to standard care.

399,One-two punch of two generics for breast cancer may be more powerful than wonder drug tamoxifen,"This story looks at two classes of drugs – aromatase inhibitors and bisphosphonates – which it says may deliver a “powerful one-two punch” when treating breast cancer. It reports on two Lancet studies that compiled data from 9 and 26 trials, respectively – what are known as meta-analyses. The studies reported on are newsworthy and there’s certainly some interesting and useful information here. But what’s missing from the piece are key details, including the fact that these drugs can cause significant side effects that may lead some women to stop taking them. Consulting an independent expert may have shed light on this issue for readers. We also think some of the language used in the story was misleading. The headline focuses the “one-two punch” of using the two types of drugs in combination, but there is no evidence in either meta-analysis to support combining the two drugs. Since that wasn’t an element of the research being reported on, why leap to that in a headline? Aromatase inhibitors have long interested scientists as an alternative to tamoxifen, the standard therapy for estrogen receptor(ER)-positive breast cancer, which may increase the risks for uterine cancer, blood clots and eye problems. Standard interventions range from surgery to drug therapy and are often invasive and toxic, sometimes causing side effects that appear months or years after treatment has ended. While non-invasive therapies found to be effective and to reduce the severity of side effects are newsworthy, readers should know that aromatase inhibitors are only used in women who’ve undergone menopause — either natural menopause or induced (e.g. by chemotherapy, oophorectomy, etc). In addition, aromatase inhibitors are not new and have been used both after a breast cancer diagnosis and to prevent breast cancer for some time. Significant side effects of aromatase inhibitors and bisphosphonates lead many women to stop taking them.",Misleading,False,False,0.20892906188964844

The release highlights the health risks associated with smoking and the estimated effectiveness of the ad campaign. The release also argues that the Tips campaign was a cost-effective means of helping people quit smoking. It provides some good background data on the health-related costs of smoking as well as estimates on how many people were reached through the ad campaign. However, the release does not give readers a hard number on the campaign’s cost. It would also have been good to know how the effectiveness of the Tips campaign compared to other “quit smoking” efforts. There are few activities as closely tied to adverse health outcomes as cigarette smoking. As the CDC notes (on its site, not in the release), “cigarette smoking harms nearly every organ of the body.” Smoking is linked to significantly increased risks of stroke, heart disease and lung cancer, with close to 500,000 deaths each year attributed to smoking in the United States. Smoking is not only a national health issue, but a global health issue. A 2015 study estimated that, globally, cigarette smoking causes approximately $500 billion in economic damage (largely through health costs) each year. For these reasons, finding effective means to help cigarette users stop smoking is clearly of widespread interest. However, that means taking a critical look at just how well anti-smoking campaigns actually work. And one way to do that is through the lens of a cost-benefit analysis, and comparing the outcomes of multiple campaigns.

The story failed to mention an estimate of how much an elevated calcium score affects risk, for example, of having a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. There was no discussion about the harms of treatment. This test does expose the patient to a small amount of radiation. It would be suggested that a woman who is pregnant or might be pregnant be sure to discuss this prior to the test. There is a chance that the test might appear positive even though there are no blockages of coronary arteries. As a result, the person might have additional testing that is unnecessary and that carries its own potential risks and side effects.

This is a thoughtful story reporting on the results of a recent study which found that the use of hormone therapy in the treatment of localized prostate cancer in older men was not beneficial. Particular strengths of the story include:  Terrific interview segments with the lead author and with two urologists. The perspective that some urologists may have once seen a """"financial windfall"""" in the use of hormone therapy, explaining some of the expansion in its use. One weakness:  The story could have (should have?) added the important point that screening for prostate cancer is not proven effective yet and remains controversial. One of the reasons so many elderly men are thrown into this difficult decision-making thicket is that the use of the PSA blood test has led to many men being diagnosed with prostate cancers of unknown significance, and leading many of them to pursue the hormone therapy that they felt rendered benefit without side effects. Bottom line of this study:  that theory was wrong.""",True,False,False,0.1986711025238037

437,Novel 'patient-friendly' colonoscopy prep shows excellent efficacy and safety,"This release summarizes an investigational study on a ‘novel’ colonoscopy bowel preparation under development by a Massachusetts-based company. The release claims that the prep is a more palatable regimen that includes solid food bars and low-volume beverages. Researchers report that by the end of the Stage 2 clinical trial, the regimen was as safe and effective as two currently available colonoscopy prep formulations in cleaning out the colon, and, importantly, participating trial volunteers gave the preparation a high rating. The release did a good job of describing the study and quantifying benefits. The existing preps that the novel formulation was compared against were never mentioned and that seems an important omission. The release also didn’t provide enough details about harms, or a ballpark cost estimate, which it seems reasonable to expect in almost all news releases. The study was presented at the American College of Gastroenterology’s 2016 annual meeting. The standard bowel preparation and prolonged fasting required to ensure a clean viewing field for the gastroentologist is daunting and has been suggested as a limiting factor in acceptance. For those approaching the magic age,  Dave Barry’s 2009 article in the Miami Herald provides a humorous look at this screening procedure. But the reality is that colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and individuals should have a discussion about the benefits and risks of the procedure. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. Should the prep described in the release hold up throughout the clinical trial process, it may be welcomed by individuals facing a colonoscopy.",Misleading,True,False,0.20515084266662598

439,Promise Seen in Drug for Retardation Syndrome,"""This report from the New York Times is a win for almost everyone. The paper gets a big scoop and a drug company gets a nice dose of front-page publicity for its experimental drug. Who loses? Anyone who think it’s important to carefully assess what happens in medical research so that good decisions can be made about treatment (i.e. the rest of us). We can understand why Novartis would choose to selectively disclose the results of an important study to a reporter and then have him collect comments about the """"surprising results"""" from others who haven’t seen the data. Such a strategy seems likely to yield plenty of positive reactions, as this story predictably reported, while limiting opportunities for unwanted hole-poking. But we think it’s unfortunate that the Times chose to play along with Novartis’s game. In our view, an interview with a hand-picked reporter is not the appropriate venue to release the results of important new medical research, and it seems naive for the Times to pass along Novartis’s perspective on the findings without being allowed to corroborate it with other expert sources. While this drug could eventually live up to its billing as """"perhaps the most promising therapeutic discovery ever for a gene-based behavioral disease,"""" as one researcher breathlessly put it, we’d prefer to at least see a study abstract before seeing these kinds of claims put down in print for all the world to base their hopes on. It’s unfortunate that these issues obscured some of the interesting background on fragile X and the research process, which was informative and engaging. Mental retardation is a condition that places a huge burden on millions of patients and their families. Treatment options are limited and generally not very effective. A new drug that addresses the source of the problem would certainly be an important development worthy of front-page coverage in the New York Times.

447,Dabigatran superior to warfarin when anticoagulation is resumed after bleeding,"This news release touts an analysis of Medicare data for 1,500 patients who suffered a major bleeding event while taking anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation. Researchers found that patients who resumed anticoagulants after a hemorrhage had better stroke and mortality rates than those who did not, and those who resumed treatment with a newer drug, dabigatran, had fewer recurrent hemorrhages than those who restarted treatment with the old standby warfarin. The news release lays out relative differences in outcomes but doesn’t include absolute risks and benefits that would convey the true significance of these findings. Nor does it mention the wide cost difference between the two drugs or the fact that prescribing patterns at the time the data were collected may have skewed the findings. Bottom line: this is an observational study, not a controlled clinical trial. It is not appropriate to be making recommendations about one drug or another based on such a study. This study sheds light on the dilemma of whether patients at risk for blood clots should resume taking anticoagulants after a major hemorrhage. Less than half of patients who survived a bleeding incident resumed taking anticoagulant drugs, apparently because their doctors perceived a high risk of recurrent bleeding. But the authors say their finding that the risk of stroke outweighs the risk of recurrent bleeding should encourage clinicians to resume anti-clotting drugs. And while the analysis shows better outcomes with a new drug compared with an old one, the authors acknowledge that finding needs to be validated in other patient groups and with more recent data. In an observational study such as this, one must be very cautious with the conclusions.",False,False,True,0.200974702835083

The study compared the effectiveness of two kinds of zinc salt in lozenges: zinc acetate and zinc gluconate. Although the studies with zinc acetate lozenges shortened colds more than those with zinc gluconate lozenges, the difference wasn’t large enough to be statistically significant. Researchers also compared the effectiveness of various doses of zinc in the lozenges and found that five trials that used low doses of 85 to 92 mg per day were just as effective as trials that used 192 to 207 mg per day. The conclusion of the study was that zinc lozenges do shorten the length of the common cold, but more studies are needed to confirm optimal ingredients of lozenges and the ideal dosage. The news release is meticulous about accuracy in reporting the study findings, but doesn’t provide any information about when zinc should be taken, the actual benefit in terms of days shaved off from suffering cold symptoms, and alternatives and disadvantages of using zinc to treat the common cold.

479,Doubts on mammogram software,"This story provides readers with a balanced discussion of the potential downside of incorporating newer technologies into routine practice too soon. Specifically, the story reports evidence recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine that computer-aided detection (CAD), a newer method of reading mammographies, was no better–and may have produced more false positives–than images read and interpreted by radiologists alone. There was 20% increase in biopsies after mammographers used the CAD software, and many of these women had non-malignant lesions. The article did not adequately describe the study. It was an observational study of select practices in the US – not randomized, not controlled and there was no information about how representative these samples were, especially in the centers that used CAD. The story reported on key results, but without adequately explaining how they were arrived at. The story provides multiple perspectives on the CAD technology in breast cancer detection. The reporter interviews not only the lead author of the NEJM study, but also the author of an accompanying editorial on this newer technology, as well as radiologists who talk about CAD in their practice. Interviews with clinicians who offer a rationale for not using the CAD technology give excellent balance to the story and provide an often overlooked perspective: newer and more high-tech devices are not necessarily better. The story notes the additional $20 per mammogram cost to Medicare with CAD. With the newer technology, costs to public health would increase via additional screening and unnecessary biopsies, and treatment would likely increase for cancers that may never become problematic (i.e. some forms of DCIS or ductal carcinoma in situ). Importantly, the story discuses the continued benefit of mammography for early detection of breast cancer. The story highlights that computer-assisted screening does not replace human judgment in interpretation of radiological films. More screening centers with the CAD technology are available; however, the new technology may not serve women any better. Traditional mammography with a radiologist interpreting the results may be more accurate and result in fewer unnecessary tests and biopsies.",True,True,True,0.20383071899414062

To then write a headline broadly claiming alleviation of chemotherapy side effects and state the “findings could bring relief to millions of patients undergoing cancer treatment” is a textbook example of overreaching and unjustified hype with significant potential for misleading — not “bringing relief” to millions. What this news release does do well is establish that altered taste and smell in cancer patients is a very real problem with very real consequences. An effective therapy could help millions of people and potentially make millions of dollars for those who develop such a treatment.

It describes a study using an artificial intelligence algorithm to recognize patterns from brain scans. The story at least warns readers that because of the small study size (just 40 subjects), larger studies would be needed to know if the reported “100% accuracy” for predicting Alzheimer’s six years before diagnosis, can actually be replicated. But beyond that, the story is full of holes and canned quotes. The news release was far more informative. Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s is a popular research area at this time. Stories about it often highlight the presumption that “catching” Alzheimer’s early will help doctors slow or stop the disease “before it starts.” Although this may have intuitive appeal there is currently no evidence to suggest this is currently feasible, or even possible in the near future. It’s an important point that should be made in all stories touching on both early diagnosis and “prevention” of this degenerative neurologic disease. This sort of framing runs a huge risk of misleading patients and their caregivers and — perhaps more disturbing — providing false hope based on what are usually preliminary findings that are by no means conclusive.",False,False,True,0.20216107368469238
501,"For pregnant women with flu, the earlier the better for antiviral treatment","This news release focuses on an observational study, published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases which reports that treating pregnant women hospitalized with severe influenza in the early stages of illness with oseltamivir (sold under the brand name Tamiflu) appears to significantly reduce the patient’s time in the hospital. The study also found that pregnant women who were hospitalized with severe flu were less likely to have been vaccinated, compared to women hospitalized with milder flu. The release covers some of the bases when explaining the study and benefits, but neglected to address potential harms that were noted in the published study and to provide needed context on the absolute risk of contracting serious influenza during early pregnancy and absolute rates of risk reductions. Influenza, or “the flu,” is a widespread disease in the United States. The CDC reports that about 40 million people in the U.S. got the flu during the 2014-15 flu season, of which 970,000 required hospitalization. And the health risks associated with flu are significant for pregnant women and their unborn children. As the CDC notes: “Changes in the immune system, heart, and lungs during pregnancy make pregnant women (and women up to two weeks postpartum) more prone to severe illness from flu, as well as to hospitalizations and even death. Pregnant women with flu also have a greater chance for serious problems for their unborn baby, including premature labor and delivery.” The research findings inform treatment and preventative care of an at-risk population — pregnant women — for a widespread and dangerous disease. That deserves our attention. At the same time, we expect experts to inform us about the true nature of the risks to pregnant women and their unborn children. The safety and effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating influenza remains a controversial topic within the medical community. Following an exhaustive review of the oseltamivir clinical trials (which it had to fight for years to obtain), the Cochrane Collaboration along with the British Medical Journal (BMJ) issued a report in 2014 that strongly questioned oseltamivir’s safety and effectiveness in combating influenza. “Initially thought to reduce hospitalisations and serious complications from influenza, the review highlights that Tamiflu is not proven to do this, and it also seems to lead to harmful effects that were not fully reported in the original publications,” wrote Cochrane editor-in-chief Dr. David Tovey, “This shows the importance of ensuring that trial data are transparent and accessible.”",Misleading,True,False,0.20119142532348633

504,How optimism may help you live longer,"A story by CBS news plays up a new study in the American Journal of Epidemiology that could give anyone reason to feel optimistic: Optimism itself is linked to a longer life, at least based on a survey of professional nurses over the years. The survey used by the researchers was the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), which reaches out to tens of thousands of medical nurses every 2 years and asks them basic questions. The data is often used to help guide public policy. The story attempts to lay out the potential benefits of optimism and their relation to various diseases and longevity–but it did so using relative risk numbers, which are not reflective of the true impact. The story also missed an important discussion about how much the results could stem from having good health–that perhaps this causes the optimism, and not vice versa. Also, no independent sources–who could provide insight and some skepticism–were included. Most everyone on Earth wants to live longer, but we often have trouble picking the healthy behaviors that lead to longevity. If a sense of optimism — a totally cost-free medical intervention — could help encourage the right behaviors, extend lifespan, and improve the quality of life, that’d be a boon around the world. Unfortunately, it’s a devilishly tricky question to ask, given the strong counterargument: Maybe healthy people just feel more optimistic because they’re doing well, while sick or injured people have a lot more to worry about and feel more pessimistic. This nuance is important to convey to readers given the limitations of this study–how it couldn’t prove cause and effect.",Misleading,True,False,0.1994163990020752

It says the study of soursop — also known as graviola or guanabana — was published, but doesn’t say where. We couldn’t find it. The release feeds rampant misinformation about this plant, falsely announcing that soursop extract is a remedy for chronic pain, anxiety and depression associated with fibromyalgia and can improve the lives of patients with that very common condition.

Unfortunately, it lacks discussion of any rigorous research supporting the clinical utility of such genetic testing, the potential harms patients might experience as a result of genetic testing, or how the specific genetic test discussed in the story differs from others currently in use. As the story notes, the Centers for Disease Control report that about one of every 20 Americans 12 and older cope with depression and some of them (not “many more,” as the story claims) experience severe side effects from the drugs used to treat depression. Finding the correct drug and the correct dosage for a specific patient can require a sometimes extended process of trial-and-error, with depression sufferers sometimes enduring multiple trials of different drugs before they find one that is effective and has an acceptably low level of negative side effects.

522,New Peer-Reviewed Clinical Study Successfully Validates The Use Of Proove Opioid Risk® To Predict Prescription Opioid Abuse,"This news release from Proove Biosciences Inc. reports on a test designed to identify those at risk of becoming addicted to opioids so doctors can improve their prescribing practices. The release summarizes a study showing that the company’s algorithm, which combines genetic markers with lifestyle and behavior variables, accurately distinguishes between healthy patients with no history of opioid abuse and patients receiving opioid addiction treatment. The study, however, may be comparing people with opioid use disorder with the wrong control group, given that a more useful distinction would be between those who have become addicted and those who have used opioids in similar circumstances without becoming addicted. In addition, the news release fails to provide information about the study’s funding source, nor does it note that four of the study’s six authors work for Proove. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioid overdose killed more than 33,000 Americans in 2015. Almost half of those who died were using a prescription opioid, although not necessarily one that had been prescribed to them. Many of those who become addicted to prescription opioids or heroin develop those addictions after being prescribed opioid painkillers. Reducing the number of deaths caused by opioid abuse has emerged as a national health priority, although policy-makers have not been able to address how to go about it — much less fund an opioid abuse reduction program. An inexpensive and reliable test that could accurately predict one’s risk of becoming addicted to opioids could be a welcome development.

525,Promise Seen in Drug for Retardation Syndrome,"""This report from the New York Times is a win for almost everyone. The paper gets a big scoop and a drug company gets a nice dose of front-page publicity for its experimental drug. Who loses? Anyone who think it’s important to carefully assess what happens in medical research so that good decisions can be made about treatment (i.e. the rest of us). We can understand why Novartis would choose to selectively disclose the results of an important study to a reporter and then have him collect comments about the """"surprising results"""" from others who haven’t seen the data. Such a strategy seems likely to yield plenty of positive reactions, as this story predictably reported, while limiting opportunities for unwanted hole-poking. But we think it’s unfortunate that the Times chose to play along with Novartis’s game. In our view, an interview with a hand-picked reporter is not the appropriate venue to release the results of important new medical research, and it seems naive for the Times to pass along Novartis’s perspective on the findings without being allowed to corroborate it with other expert sources. While this drug could eventually live up to its billing as """"perhaps the most promising therapeutic discovery ever for a gene-based behavioral disease,"""" as one researcher breathlessly put it, we’d prefer to at least see a study abstract before seeing these kinds of claims put down in print for all the world to base their hopes on. It’s unfortunate that these issues obscured some of the interesting background on fragile X and the research process, which was informative and engaging. Mental retardation is a condition that places a huge burden on millions of patients and their families. Treatment options are limited and generally not very effective. A new drug that addresses the source of the problem would certainly be an important development worthy of front-page coverage in the New York Times. However, it is critical not to instill false hope by overhyping experimental drugs before their benefits are proven.""",Misleading,False,False,0.19618916511535645

Families, students, schools, and public health specialists are in a frustrating battle to prevent and address obesity and its damaging consequences. As this release notes, this may be especially true in poor, urban and minority children and teens whose diets are more likely to be composed of fast food meals, and sugary, greasy, nutritionally deficient snacks after school. Widely publicized efforts — like New York City’s ban on large-sized soda pop sales — to introduce teens (and adults) to healthier diets, haven’t seemed to do much to increase desire for carrot sticks, fruit, and yogurt in these populations.

Knee pain from osteoarthritis is a growing problem among the aging population and new approaches to reduce this type of pain could improve the quality of life for many older patients.

577,Dabigatran superior to warfarin when anticoagulation is resumed after bleeding,"This news release touts an analysis of Medicare data for 1,500 patients who suffered a major bleeding event while taking anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation. Researchers found that patients who resumed anticoagulants after a hemorrhage had better stroke and mortality rates than those who did not, and those who resumed treatment with a newer drug, dabigatran, had fewer recurrent hemorrhages than those who restarted treatment with the old standby warfarin. The news release lays out relative differences in outcomes but doesn’t include absolute risks and benefits that would convey the true significance of these findings. Nor does it mention the wide cost difference between the two drugs or the fact that prescribing patterns at the time the data were collected may have skewed the findings. Bottom line: this is an observational study, not a controlled clinical trial. It is not appropriate to be making recommendations about one drug or another based on such a study. This study sheds light on the dilemma of whether patients at risk for blood clots should resume taking anticoagulants after a major hemorrhage. Less than half of patients who survived a bleeding incident resumed taking anticoagulant drugs, apparently because their doctors perceived a high risk of recurrent bleeding. But the authors say their finding that the risk of stroke outweighs the risk of recurrent bleeding should encourage clinicians to resume anti-clotting drugs. And while the analysis shows better outcomes with a new drug compared with an old one, the authors acknowledge that finding needs to be validated in other patient groups and with more recent data. In an observational study such as this, one must be very cautious with the conclusions.",False,False,True,0.19745945930480957
578,Researchers develop test for pregnancy complication,"""This story took preliminary research on a diagnostic test for a common and urgent pregnancy complication—preeclampsia—and made the research appear to be a life-saving medical breakthrough. In the study, an international group of researchers reported identifying a “metabolic signature”—a group of 14 biomarkers in the blood of pregnant women—that might aid in the diagnosis of preeclampsia in its early stages. The diagnostic test, like any complex diagnostic technology, faces years of research development and clinical trials. The article offered a best-case scenario for the development of this test. It did not provide a single cautionary note to balance out this hopeful view. The main question that goes unanswered in this story is whether a diagnostic test that was studied in 120 women and then validated in 79 pregnant women in Australia will be equally valuable for millions of women around the world. Will it turn into a test that can be administered simply and interpreted easily? Could it be just as useful in Mali, Cambodia, or Micronesia as it might be in developed nations? Will the test have adequate predictive value—both positive and negative—in a wide range of ethnic groups and among women with differing health problems? Only time and further research will tell. If this test lives up the diagnostic potential envisioned in the Reuters story, it would be a major step forward indeed. But the story should have provided more independent experts to give a more balanced view of the evidence that supports it. The Reuters article closed with an optimistic quote from Eleni Tsigas, Executive Director of the Preeclampsia Foundation, on the potential of this test to identify women at risk. But perhaps the article should have included another quote from Tsigas that appeared in a Canadian newspaper: “I am not going to be breaking out the champagne yet…” (See Wingrove J, Globe and Mail, September 13, 2010). Preeclampsia is a common but poorly understood pregnancy complication characterized by dangerously high blood pressure and elevated levels of protein in the urine. It affects up to 8% of pregnancies worldwide, with a particularly damaging impact in developing nations. In the United States preeclampsia is the root cause of 18% of maternal deaths. For babies born prematurely because of maternal preeclampsia, it is an important precursor of developmental abnormalities. The identification of a diagnostic test for preeclampsia has been termed the """"Holy Grail of obstetrics."""" If preeclampsia could be recognized early in pregnancy, it might be possible to ward off some of its potentially serious consequences through vigilant surveillance of mother and baby. And identification of early changes that precede preeclampsia might boost research efforts into finding more effective treatments.""",Misleading,True,False,0.19756627082824707

591,How to heal head injuries?

The study, summarized in a letter in JAMA Pediatrics, was designed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia to test the feasibility of gathering real-time data from objective measures. The story contains some original reporting but misleads readers when it takes its lead from the news release and asserts that the observational findings “suggest that the right balance during recovering from concussion may be resting one’s brain but still getting some physical activity.” In reality, the main conclusion of the study was simply that the app can be a useful tool for tracking activity following a concussion. This misleading notion is reinforced by the headline, “How to heal head injuries? Try a new app.” It’s not available for trying, and it’s not intended to heal head injuries. A more accurate headline would be “Researchers determine app may be reliable way to track activity and symptoms after a concussion, pending further research.”   Concussion was diagnosed in about 1.5 percent of 11- to 19-year-olds in 2015, the highest rate of any age group, according to a Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association report.

The supposed benefit of raloxifene over tamoxifen is about the prevalence of side effects and so this distinction is important. This is issue is then compounded by the quote from the surgical oncologist “Obviously, if a woman says she’s had a deep vein thrombosis before, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend the other” because it is clear that this is not an evidenced-based statement. It’s fine to include that comment, but important to put it in context of the evidence.

Knee pain from osteoarthritis is a growing problem among the aging population and new approaches to reduce this type of pain could improve the quality of life for many older patients. Any non-opioid or  non-surgical approach which can match the success of knee replacement surgery in resolving pain and improving function would be an advance in caring for people with disabling osteoarthritis of the knee.

609,Laparoscopic anti-reflux operation for GERD linked to fewer postoperative complications,"A new study by the American College of Surgeons, a professional organization, compared records for 75,000 patients who underwent surgery for GERD, or gastrointestinal esophageal reflux disease. The study looked at two different surgical procedures and found the less invasive one seemed equally effective, but kept patients in the hospital a shorter time with fewer complications. The news release did a good job of discussing surgical alternatives and costs, which were estimated to be $9,000 lower for the less invasive laparoscopic procedure. The release would have been better had it spelled out some of the study limitations, the key one being that a retrospective, observational review of hospital records — as this study was — isn’t capable of supporting the cause and effect statements sprinkled throughout the release. Millions of Americans complain of occasional heartburn, sometimes called a burning sensation in the throat from food coming back up from the stomach. But some estimates are that about 20 percent of US adults fit the definition of GERD, which means they suffer symptoms at least every week. If patients consider a surgical fix, this study shows that a less-invasive procedure could reduce their complications and shorten their hospital stay. It’s hard to pin down stats on GERD prevalence. A 2014 review of 16 epidemiological studies of GERD prevalence published in the journal Gut suggest GERD prevalence ranges from “18.1%-27.8% in North America, 8.8%-25.9% in Europe, 2.5%-7.8% in East Asia, 8.7%-33.1% in the Middle East, 11.6% in Australia and 23.0% in South America.”",True,True,True,0.2042398452758789

612,Prenatal blood test for Down syndrome shows high level of accuracy,"Overall, this story didn’t provide some of the key information readers need to make sense out of this study on a new blood test for Down syndrome. We wanted to see cost information, hear some good independent commentary on the study and, above all, read some context about why this test is worth any ink at all. Doing testing for 824 screenings, of which 11% were technical failures, is not a proof of concept yet for what would need to be millions of tests nationally and thousands per clinical lab if used in clinical practice. This story needed more context to give people the proper context to understand that. Screening for genetic anomalies during pregnancy can be stressful for expectant mothers. They dread that they will find out something is wrong with their baby, and they also dread that the test itself will cause them to miscarry. This story helps women understand the long odds that either of those scenarios will happen, and it goes part of the way toward helping them understand the importance of these new findings. But the story does conflate the screening and diagnostic process beginning with the first paragraph when it links the new test with “prenatal testing” done by amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling. This new test is not a diagnostic test, as those tests are. Rather, as the authors of the BMJ paper confirm, it is a “screen for fetal trisomy 21 among high risk pregnancies.” This is a “hope for the future” level test that may be inching its way to market.

613,Novel 'patient-friendly' colonoscopy prep shows excellent efficacy and safety,"This release summarizes an investigational study on a ‘novel’ colonoscopy bowel preparation under development by a Massachusetts-based company. The release claims that the prep is a more palatable regimen that includes solid food bars and low-volume beverages. Researchers report that by the end of the Stage 2 clinical trial, the regimen was as safe and effective as two currently available colonoscopy prep formulations in cleaning out the colon, and, importantly, participating trial volunteers gave the preparation a high rating. The release did a good job of describing the study and quantifying benefits. The existing preps that the novel formulation was compared against were never mentioned and that seems an important omission. The release also didn’t provide enough details about harms, or a ballpark cost estimate, which it seems reasonable to expect in almost all news releases. The study was presented at the American College of Gastroenterology’s 2016 annual meeting. The standard bowel preparation and prolonged fasting required to ensure a clean viewing field for the gastroentologist is daunting and has been suggested as a limiting factor in acceptance. For those approaching the magic age,  Dave Barry’s 2009 article in the Miami Herald provides a humorous look at this screening procedure. But the reality is that colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and individuals should have a discussion about the benefits and risks of the procedure. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. Should the prep described in the release hold up throughout the clinical trial process, it may be welcomed by individuals facing a colonoscopy.",Misleading,True,False,0.20469355583190918

621,Multivitamins in pregnancy may be linked to lower autism risk in children,"This BMJ news release suggests that a new study found a correlation between multivitamin use and reduced incidence of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We commend the release for noting that the study findings show a correlation, not causation, and for making a call for more research. However, the largest drawback of the release is that it doesn’t provide any actual data from the study. The release did call out some limitations of the research but would have been even stronger had it mentioned some very obvious differences between the group of mothers-to-be that took multivitamins and the expectant mothers who did not take supplements. The multivitamin group is more educated, in a higher socioeconomic group, has fewer smokers, are of more normal weight, more were born in Sweden and more were experiencing their first pregnancy. The presence of a higher percentage of women with overweight in the no vitamin group suggests that there are other nutritional factors that are unknown and may influence or increase the risk of having a child with ASD. Environmental factors in autism spectrum disorder are an area of active research as the prevalence of diagnosis has doubled since the year 2000. (Genetic influences are also actively studied.) Because these disorders are developmental in nature, prenatal influences are of particular interest. Ideally, continued research on nutritional influences might someday lead to advice for pregnant women to reduce the chances of having a child with ASD.",Misleading,True,False,0.20168209075927734

625,Marijuana Chemical Shows Promise for Hard-to-Treat Epilepsy in Kids,"Efficacy and safety studies of a marijuana-derived oil on children for whom existing drugs fail to control epileptic seizures support moving cannabidiol into clinical studies.

The story in this case makes the shortcomings of the evidence a prominent point in the coverage and we applaud this careful approach. But whether desperate parents will heed that signal is another matter. A source notes in the story that a “major” clinical trial’s results will become available early in 2016.

Parents of epileptic kids whose seizures are not responsive to anti-seizure medicines will be on the lookout for alternatives.

635,Pilot clinical trial finds injected immune cells safe in multiple myeloma patients,"This is a report of a phase I clinical trial testing whether specific immune cells harvested from the bone marrow, grown in the lab and then re-infused into multiple myeloma patients can effectively change the immune environment in the patient and suggest a possibly improved disease outcome. It looks at using a different population of immune cells — marrow-infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs) — from those used in previous studies. These are both easier to retrieve and easier to grow in the lab, two factors that reduce the complexity of this treatment approach. The release is in many ways a model for other organizations reporting on similar studies. The description of the study is clear, the language used appropriately conservative, and there is context regarding the novelty of the approach and current alternative treatments. Some discussion of possible costs — preliminary though it would have to be — would have completed the picture for readers. Rather than hyping such a study in a frenzied attempt to attract clicks and eyeballs, Hopkins presents the findings in a thoughtful way that reflects well on the institution’s reputation and will help build that reputation over the long haul. Multiple myeloma is one of several cancers of the blood and the National Cancer Institute estimates that nearly 27,000 new cases of myeloma will be diagnosed this year. Less than half of patients live as much as five years after their diagnosis, and more than 11,000 patients are expected to die from the disease this year.

HbA1c is a measure of average blood sugar levels over the preceding three months. The study documented moderate reductions in HbA1c during the last 5 years of this 8-year study. The release would have been improved had it included absolute rather than relative numbers and a clarification of whether study participants were on insulin at the time of the study. Other factors could have contributed to the reduction of HbA1c levels over an 8-year period. The STAT story on this same research, which we also reviewed, focused on a smaller group of 9 patients who’ve been followed for more than 5 years. Type I diabetes accounts for about 5-10% of all diabetes and can occur in both adults and children. It’s believed to be caused primarily by the auto-immune destruction of the insulin-producing (beta) cells of the pancreas, making people who have it dependent on injected insulin.There is currently no cure for type 1 diabetes aside from pancreatic transplant. It’s important to bear in mind that HbA1c levels are commonly used as a  surrogate marker in diabetes research. Reductions in this marker don’t necessarily equate with less complications or better outcomes in people with either type I or type 2 diabetes and studies using HbA1c as an intermediate outcome have been limited by their short follow-up and linkage to long-term, clinically meaningful, outcomes.",Misleading,False,False,0.20291495323181152

638,Phase 3 analyses in Alzheimer's show clinical benefit of tramiprosate in APOE4 carriers,"This news release from a public relations firm on behalf of drug manufacturer, Alzheon, describes an experimental compound tramiprosate that showed some impact on patients carrying the APOE4 gene which is present in many people who go on to develop Alzheimer’s disease. The drug is thought to target amyloid — protein fragments that aggregate abnormally in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. But the dense technical language of the release prevents most readers from understanding the scale of the improvement reported in patient thinking or behavior during this study. The major drawback of the release is that it didn’t talk about limitations of the sub-group analysis. While exploratory, this sub-group analysis cannot lead one to draw any conclusions about whether the drug “worked,” given that the overall study was negative. The release also did not help readers understand when the drug would be prescribed, in relation to diagnosis, if the drug is approved. Estimates are that more than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive and disabling neurological disorder. This release about a drug that might slow decline or ease symptoms is disappointing. It claims the drug works, but doesn’t make it clear for readers just how well.

Lung cancer is a life-threatening disease at any age and news about treatments are of interest to a wide audience. This release describes results from an observational study of patients treated for early stage lung cancer with stereotactic body radiation treatment (SBRT) between 2004 and 2014. The release notes that the study looked at treatment outcomes broken down by age and suggests that treatment benefits were similar, but the release didn’t describe any harms from SBRT treatment and whether they varied by patient age.

In the first study, researchers found that a significant number of young women had iron deficiency that wasn’t quite as severe as anemia. In the second study, they tried to find a way to predict who might have iron deficiency by asking about fatigue and other factors, but were unable to find a predictive question. The release declares that doctors should screen all teens for “iron deficiency” but this conclusion seems beyond the scope of the two studies. Finding teens who may suffer health issues from iron deficiency is a great goal. However, whether universal screening is the best way requires further research. For more context about the potential harms of over-screening, see this blog post from our archives. Screening every 16-year-old girl in the US for “iron deficiency” may not be the best idea. This news release goes too far in reporting on two studies about iron deficiency, which is a health issue for some teens. Readers are not given any balancing context on whether the screening could cause anxiety or lead to false-positive diagnoses that could lead to unnecessary treatment. These studies were exploratory and attempt to identify factors that medical staff could use to more selectively screen teens (or screen earlier) for iron deficiency. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend routine screening for anemia. The release stated that several adverse associations exist with anemia (lower math scores, poor attention) but those are likely associated with more severe anemia and it is not clear that the relationship is causal. In fact, screening more aggressively for iron deficiency could result in over-treatment.",Misleading,False,False,0.20132231712341309

660,Beyond wrinkles: Botox is a salve for everything from cerebral palsy to writer’s cramp,"This is a thoroughly reported story on a medical therapy that merits skepticism but which has also earned a reasonable amount of scientific respect in recent years. It does a nice job of explaining the myriad uses of Botox in medicine today and issues some needed cautions about potential harms, nonapproved uses, and misuse. The story’s sources are plentiful and appear to be balanced. But is this enough? How good is the evidence to support the various uses of Botox? Are there reasonable alternatives to Botox for some of the conditions it treats? Is it okay to tease a national audience with a headline that shouts one thing, but place deeper in the story the caveats that suggest another? There is extraordinary variability in the quality of the research on Botox from one medical condition to another—missing information important for a national audience that inevitably includes people searching desperately for solutions to intractable problems. For example, our quick literature search turned up more than a score of randomized, controlled trials and systematic reviews on the use of Botox for the involuntary muscle contortions that cause the painful neck disorder known as cervical dystonia–and just one, very small, inadequate trial on Botox treatments for low back pain. The story fails to quantify side effects, most of which seem to be dismissed as transient. And readers might be better served if the story put more meat on the bones of alternative approaches (including no treatment) to some of the conditions Botox treats. Indeed, one could argue that the story’s ultimate effect is that of treatment mongering—simply because it shines so much (mostly flattering) light on Botox. The admonition from one source—“Don’t demand a certain treatment just because you saw a headline”—can’t compete with the magazine cover’s actual headline: “The Botox Boom” followed inside by, “You thought Botox was all about looks?

662,Exercise reduces heart disease risk in depressed patients,"This American Academy of Cardiology news release follows a well-trodden path in health news of promoting the benefits of regular exercise. We’re not complaining about yet another article telling us exercise is good. But that’s besides the point because, in fact, the news release fails to grasp that the study is observational in nature, rendering the title of the document — “Exercise reduces heart disease risk in depressed patients” — unsubstantiated. The study is much more cautious about drawing any conclusions from this non-randomized research but you won’t find any of those cautions in the release. The takeaway message of the study is not so much that “exercise is good for you.” Rather, the study seeks to establish whether physical exercise modifies the link between depression and cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular complications are often observed in people with depressive disorders. The observational study behind this news release seems to suggest that physical exercise could be used to improve cardiovascular risk stratification. The researchers also seemed to be trying to determine the mechanism by which exercise or the lack of it impacts risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as inflammation, oxidative stress and arterial stiffness. The more we understand about connections between depression, exercise and heart disease the better. To what degree do depression and exercise alone or together impact heart health? The study — but not the release — offers some insight into understanding the relationship but doesn’t claim any definitive conclusions. A depressed person reading the release might find it counter-intuitive to say they may reduce their risk for developing cardiovascular disease by taking up exercise.

670,Minimally invasive treatment reduces knee pain and disability from osteoarthritis,"This release outlines interim results from a small  clinical trial proposing a new treatment — geniculate artery embolization (GAE) — to reduce the pain in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The study was presented at the Society of Interventional Radiology’s annual meeting. The main concerns with this report are the small study size (just 13 patients) and the brief duration of the study. Outcomes include results only through 1 month after the procedure. Almost half of the patients didn’t complete the 1-month follow-up assessment. The study didn’t include a control group. The release also ignored the potential risks of the procedure and its costs. Knee pain from osteoarthritis is a growing problem among the aging population and new approaches to reduce this type of pain could improve the quality of life for many older patients. Any non-opioid or  non-surgical approach which can match the success of knee replacement surgery in resolving pain and improving function would be an advance in caring for people with disabling osteoarthritis of the knee. But this release, and the extremely early stage of this research, goes too far in its claims of benefit.

672,How to heal head injuries? Try new app,"This story describes a pilot study that used an app to track cognitive and physical activity in 34 young concussion patients during the two weeks after their injuries. The study, summarized in a letter in JAMA Pediatrics, was designed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia to test the feasibility of gathering real-time data from objective measures. The story contains some original reporting but misleads readers when it takes its lead from the news release and asserts that the observational findings “suggest that the right balance during recovering from concussion may be resting one’s brain but still getting some physical activity.” In reality, the main conclusion of the study was simply that the app can be a useful tool for tracking activity following a concussion. This misleading notion is reinforced by the headline, “How to heal head injuries? Try a new app.” It’s not available for trying, and it’s not intended to heal head injuries. A more accurate headline would be “Researchers determine app may be reliable way to track activity and symptoms after a concussion, pending further research.”   Concussion was diagnosed in about 1.5 percent of 11- to 19-year-olds in 2015, the highest rate of any age group, according to a Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association report. Since teens and smart phones are pretty much inseparable, an app could be a useful tool for researchers to track symptoms and compliance around activity.

690,Dabigatran superior to warfarin when anticoagulation is resumed after bleeding,"This news release touts an analysis of Medicare data for 1,500 patients who suffered a major bleeding event while taking anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation. Researchers found that patients who resumed anticoagulants after a hemorrhage had better stroke and mortality rates than those who did not, and those who resumed treatment with a newer drug, dabigatran, had fewer recurrent hemorrhages than those who restarted treatment with the old standby warfarin. The news release lays out relative differences in outcomes but doesn’t include absolute risks and benefits that would convey the true significance of these findings. Nor does it mention the wide cost difference between the two drugs or the fact that prescribing patterns at the time the data were collected may have skewed the findings. Bottom line: this is an observational study, not a controlled clinical trial. It is not appropriate to be making recommendations about one drug or another based on such a study. This study sheds light on the dilemma of whether patients at risk for blood clots should resume taking anticoagulants after a major hemorrhage. Less than half of patients who survived a bleeding incident resumed taking anticoagulant drugs, apparently because their doctors perceived a high risk of recurrent bleeding. But the authors say their finding that the risk of stroke outweighs the risk of recurrent bleeding should encourage clinicians to resume anti-clotting drugs. And while the analysis shows better outcomes with a new drug compared with an old one, the authors acknowledge that finding needs to be validated in other patient groups and with more recent data.

The perspective that some urologists may have once seen a """"financial windfall"""" in the use of hormone therapy, explaining some of the expansion in its use. One weakness:  The story could have (should have?) added the important point that screening for prostate cancer is not proven effective yet and remains controversial. One of the reasons so many elderly men are thrown into this difficult decision-making thicket is that the use of the PSA blood test has led to many men being diagnosed with prostate cancers of unknown significance, and leading many of them to pursue the hormone therapy that they felt rendered benefit without side effects. Bottom line of this study:  that theory was wrong.""",True,False,False,0.19688200950622559

728,Device Keeps Donor Kidneys Healthy Outside the Body Until Transplant,"The news release focuses on a successful kidney transplant in which the donor organ was kept viable using a technique known as “ex vivo organ perfusion.” The release provides a lot of information on what the surgery entails, and why. However, the release left out some key details. Are there risks associated with this technique? What sort of expenses are involved for patients? What sort of questions and concerns are still outstanding? The release does tell readers that the transplant was done as part of a phase 1 clinical trial — and that future trials will address whether the technique is effective. Which raises the question: Why are they issuing a news release now? According to the National Kidney Foundation, there are tens of thousands of people on the waiting list for a kidney donation — with thousands more being added to the list each month. That means there a lot of people, and their loved ones, who are anxious for good news regarding kidney donation. Trumpeting one successful kidney transplant that took advantage of an experimental ex vivo organ perfusion technique may well raise hopes for no reason. At best, it will likely be years before the technique finds widespread clinical use — it is, after all, in the earliest of clinical trials. We do not know how long those clinical trials will take, or if the technique will even advance beyond a phase 1 clinical trial. We do not know if the technique may cause unforeseen problems even in the patient who has received this initial transplant.

732,"Soy, cruciferous vegetables associated with fewer common breast cancer treatment side effects – Georgetown University Medical Center","This news release rather thinly describes a study designed to demonstrate whether chemicals naturally found in soy-based foods and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and kale are linked to reduced side effects of hormone-related treatments among breast cancer survivors. Although the release ably describes some of the reasons the dietary intervention might work and how, it offers no numbers or measurements to support the conclusion that these foods are associated with fewer menopausal symptoms such as fatigue and hot flashes. Nor does it describe how dietary data were collected, and thus how reliable they are. While it aptly cautions breast cancer patients not to start a soy-rich diet until further research is done, it doesn’t say why caution is recommend. Nor does it describe just how much of these foods might be considered beneficial or harmful in a normal diet. So-called “chemoprotective” or “chemopreventive” components such as sulforaphanes found in broccoli sprouts and in soy products have for decades been the subject of studies designed to link them to lower prostate and other cancer rates and to other health benefits. If in fact dietary interventions can be shown to reduce common side effects of breast cancer treatments — particularly those that affect estrogen — women might be more interested in long-term therapies that suppress female hormones, and also greatly improve the quality of their lives.

737,Statins 'could be valuable addition to breast cancer treatment',"This story springs from a recent lab study in the UK showing that breast cancer cells can use cholesterol molecules to mimic estrogen in order to grow, offering a potential reason why some breast cancers resist standard anti-hormone treatments. The headline makes a quantum leap in logic in declaring that statin drugs used to lower cholesterol “could be valuable addition to breast cancer treatment.” Similarly, the opening paragraph states that researchers “have raised the possibility of using statins” to stop breast cancer recurrence. That’s rampant speculation, not supported by the research being reported on, and the story should have clarified this. Offering hope that a potential new discovery could curb recurrence makes for intriguing journalism, but if not framed correctly, it is a disservice to breast cancer survivors, especially with such nascent science. More than 2.8 million U.S. women have been diagnosed with breast cancer. After initial treatment, breast cancers that have a large number of estrogen receptors — which constitute the majority of cases — can continue to be treated with hormone therapies such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, which help prevent recurrence by cutting off hormones that feed the cancer cells. But resistance to these drugs remains a problem. About a third of women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer experience a recurrence, often more than five years after the initial diagnosis and treatment. For many breast cancer survivors, the chance of recurrence constitutes an ongoing trauma.",False,False,True,0.20037317276000977

However, the story doesn’t evaluate the evidence for these claims. How well does the device work in real patients compared to existing systems? It’s a pretty key question that goes unanswered. More than 29 million Americans have diabetes, according the CDC. The disease requires that patients check their glucose levels throughout the day and self-administer insulin to keep those levels within a normal range. Improvements in medical technology over the past few decades have meant blood sugar monitoring and insulin delivery that is both more accurate and more convenient, helping people with diabetes maintain steadier glucose levels and have fewer crisis events.

751,Magnet device aims to treat depression patients,"""For people suffering from severe depression who have not responded to medical treatment, the idea that a non-invasive procedure is now available is welcome news. On October 8, 2008, the FDA announced that they had cleared transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, for patients who had not responded to antidepressant therapy. However, because TMS is not an implantable device, the FDA was merely required to clear the device on the basis that it was """"safe and equivalent"""" to electro-shock therapy. The ruling does not claim that TMS is effective, and many questions remain about just how much benefit TMS provides compared to existing treatments. This story does not exaggerate the seriousness or prevalence of depression and thereby avoids disease mongering. The story is also clear to point out that the FDA approval is specifically for people who have failed first-line treatment with medication. The story could have done more to explain that TMS is not for people who have mild depression or who have not attempted other forms of treatment first. The story does a good job of describing the costs of TMS, which are significantly higher than medication, and of describing the novelty of TMS. Although TMS itself is not new, it has only recently been studied as a possible treatment, rather than just a research tool. The story does provide some quantification of benefits of TMS, describing what percentage of subjects scored significantly better on standard depression scores after treatment with TMS compared to sham. However, it was not clear from the story what """"significantly better"""" meant and if that translates into real clinical differences for the patient. The story mentions antidepressants and shock therapy but does not mention other very effective treatments for depression, including psychotherapy, either in combination with medication or by itself, and self-help techniques. Nor does the story explain that there are many different antidepressants and if a patient does not respond to one drug, other drugs can be tried before resorting to TMS. In addition, the story misrepresents shock therapy as a """"last resort"""" treatment. While shock therapy isn’t the first choice for many people, it could be a reasonable choice in certain clinical situation. Describing shock therapy in this way may be harmful to patients and families who are considering shock therapy at a time when it is likely to help. Furthermore, while the story describes the study and points out that the FDA had many concerns about it, the story does not describe what those concerns were. The story does explain that a new study should provide better data, but does not mention that this approval comes after a prior panel found insufficient evidence to support TMS. That the story focused only on the current study and FDA decision without putting it into context of the whole body of literature on the subject is problematic. Also, the story mentions that TMS was recently approved. However, the story should have emphasized that it is still considered experimental in spite of the approval and its availability is limited to a few research centers. Finally, the story quotes two experts who are both involved in the research on TMS in depression. The story should have quoted additional experts who do not have a stake in the outcome to provide some much needed balance. The story did not explicitly address whether the researchers had any financial conflict of interest.""",Misleading,True,False,0.19789695739746094

760,"Earlier blood testing for iron deficiency, anemia recommended for young women","This release reports on two separate studies, one combing the medical histories and records of more than 6,000 women, and another where 96 patients were surveyed. In the first study, researchers found that a significant number of young women had iron deficiency that wasn’t quite as severe as anemia. In the second study, they tried to find a way to predict who might have iron deficiency by asking about fatigue and other factors, but were unable to find a predictive question. The release declares that doctors should screen all teens for “iron deficiency” but this conclusion seems beyond the scope of the two studies. Finding teens who may suffer health issues from iron deficiency is a great goal. However, whether universal screening is the best way requires further research. For more context about the potential harms of over-screening, see this blog post from our archives. Screening every 16-year-old girl in the US for “iron deficiency” may not be the best idea. This news release goes too far in reporting on two studies about iron deficiency, which is a health issue for some teens. Readers are not given any balancing context on whether the screening could cause anxiety or lead to false-positive diagnoses that could lead to unnecessary treatment. These studies were exploratory and attempt to identify factors that medical staff could use to more selectively screen teens (or screen earlier) for iron deficiency. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend routine screening for anemia.

763,Preliminary Data from Study Demonstrates 94% Accuracy in Detecting Aggressive Prostate Cancer,"This news release is about a blood test intended to more specifically define a man’s likelihood of having a high-grade prostate cancer tumor. It alerts readers several times to the preliminary nature of the small “proof of concept” study. However, highlighting a “94% accuracy” in the headline and lead paragraph is unjustified. The release does not mention cost, nor does it adequately discuss potential benefits or harms. The release implies that this test offers something unique, but it fails to tell readers that other blood tests are much farther along in the research process. “Preliminary,” “proof of concept” and references to the need to confirm and expand the findings of a study all point out how much more work needs to be done in order to find out if this experimental blood test might offer anything of value. Putting a number on the “accuracy” of the test, especially without defining or explaining details of the assessment, implies a level of certainty that does not exist. It is well known that the PSA test for prostate cancer screening isn’t very reliable. There are several efforts underway to develop improved tests. The biggest problem is that the PSA test isn’t very specific — meaning that a man with an abnormal test result may not have cancer. That is termed a “false positive” test. Even among those with an abnormal PSA test who are diagnosed with cancer, many of these cancers (some experts suggest up to 40%) may be so small or otherwise innocuous that they really should be left alone. Can a new test be developed that identifies cancers that need to be treated more accurately than the currently available tests? As presented, a reader may surmise that this new test looks promising, but for a number of reasons it may be “too good to be true.” First, we don’t know very much about the men studied, but often patients in such initial studies are more likely to have prostate cancers that need treatment. When later the test is applied to a larger, more diverse population, the test may not perform as well. Moreover, the definition of what is a cancer that requires treatment is not clearly stated in this release. We know that the referenced Gleason score which is based upon the biopsy specimen isn’t perfect either and we’re not sure what criteria was used in this study. Finally, any new test that cuts down on false positive results is likely to lead to missing some cancers that really do need treatment. These are termed false negative test results.",False,True,False,0.20219063758850098

769,KETAMINE SHOWS PROMISE AS TREATMENT FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH DEPRESSION,"This story reported on a preliminary study looking at whether the drug ketamine might be a potential treatment for adolescent depression. The story refrained from disease-mongering and quantified the scope of the observed benefits. However, the headline and lead were misleading in stating that teens who took the drug had improvements in their depression. The word “promise” used in the headline wasn’t borne out by the data. In fact, the study wasn’t designed to offer reliable evidence that the drug offers a benefit. Caveats about the study were included only toward the end of the story, and readers were left in the dark about ketamine’s potential for misuse and its potential side effects. Costs were also missing. Adolescent depression is a widespread problem, and a substantial number of adolescents don’t respond successfully to drugs that are currently available. Given high public interest in an effective alternative, news reports should refrain from encouraging false hopes when it comes to early-stage research. That means emphasizing appropriate caveats with the quality of evidence and refraining from making claims that aren’t borne out by the data. In addition, potential harms should be spelled out, particularly when it comes to the unknown effects of long-term use on developing brains and bodies.",Misleading,False,False,0.20327377319335938

It also says that “a form of talk therapy, as well as exercise, offered relief for some patients.” How many? We like that the story tapped some outside expertise to put the study’s findings in context, but the story was too short in other areas.

Is it several disorders that are ill defined and difficult to pinpoint and so end up being tossed under the same umbrella? Is it all in the patient’s mind? it can be a devastating condition – affecting physical, emotional function and financial well-being. Because science has yielded few clues to the origin and true nature of the syndrome, it is all the more important for journalists to write with precision when addressing a new scientific attempt to address chronic fatigue.

One of the painkillers was a combination of the over-the-counter medications acetaminophen and ibuprofen; the other three painkillers were combinations of acetaminophen and an opioid (oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine). The study found that — within the two-hour window being evaluated — there was no statistical significant difference in the effectiveness of the four drugs, indicating that acetaminophen/ibuprofen is a viable alternative to opioids for addressing acute pain. The story is exceptionally concise — a news brief rather than a feature — but does a good job of describing the study and placing it in the context of the “opioid crisis” in the U.S. But much like a related news release, which we also reviewed, the story fails to place the findings in context with previous research on the relative efficacy of opioid and non-opioid painkillers. The story does a lot of things well, particularly given its brevity. It describes the study well and makes clear that the study is important because of the ongoing opioid crisis in the United States. As we noted when reviewing a news release on this study, the American Society of Addiction Medicine reports that at least 2 million Americans had an addiction to prescription painkillers in 2015 — and more than 20,000 people died from prescription painkiller overdoses in the same year. And data from the National Institute of Drug Abuse show that this problem is on the rise. However, any story about research findings will be stronger if it explains how new findings are consistent with or differ from previous research in the field. That may be especially true here.

828,Mayo Clinic finds surprising results on first-ever test of stem cell therapy to treat arthritis,"This release from the Mayo Clinic describes the essentially negative results of a small, randomized and partly controlled trial of a widely used, but unproven treatment for arthritis. The treatment involves injecting a person’s own bone marrow containing pluripotent stem cells directly into arthritis-damaged knees. Popular in “regenerative medicine” clinics, Bone Marrow Aspirate Concentrate (BMAC) therapy, and a related therapy using Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) from blood, cost many thousands of dollars and are not covered by insurance. BMAC therapy currently does not require FDA approval since many of its practitioners have argued successfully that harvesting cells from one’s own body and re-injecting them without complex processing does not constitute “a drug.” But neither has there been rigorous scientific testing for efficacy, adverse side effects, benefit compared with other treatments, and safety. The good news is that the Mayo Clinic study was designed to put some science behind a choice to use BMAC, which a few published articles conclude has helped many patients and for long periods of time. The release notes that the study failed to make a scientific case that the therapy works to heal, cure or diminish osteoarthritic pain mainly because the 25 patients — each with two bad knees — served as their own controls for BMAC and it turns out that the “control” knees injected with plain saline benefited just as much as the stem cell treated knees. Overall, the release uses weaselly language to give the stem cell treatment more benefit of the doubt than it deserves here, and devotes a lot of space making a case for the possibility that the injection of stem cells in one set of knees somehow “spread” systemically to the other knees. A meaningful discussion of harms and benefits are also missing. Painful, debilitating osteoarthritis of the knees and other joints, especially in the elderly and in athletes, joggers, and sports enthusiasts, are a major cause of disability. Treatments with anti-inflammatories, steroids, surgery and painkillers all carry potential risks and the overall health care cost to individuals and society is significant. As the release notes, at least 600 stem cell clinics in the U.S. alone have offered at least one form of BMAC to more than 100,000 patients seeking cures or long-lasting pain-reducing treatment. This study seeks to assess whether the use of a patient’s own bone marrow stem cells is a treatment for osteoarthritis, or arthritis of aging. This treatment and similar ones seek to find an option that is less invasive than surgery but more effective than existing treatments. The investigators report that both knees improved “dramatically,” but unexpectedly. The knee injected with the salt water solution did just as well as the knee injected with the active stem cell treatment. In summary, the study is an important one in that it calls into question the unproven benefit of using a patient’s own bone marrow as a treatment for painful arthritis. Further studies should include double-blind design where one patient gets stem cells while another only gets the saline placebo.",Misleading,False,False,0.20344972610473633

We appreciate that journalists sometimes want to bring their own perspective to a story, and we think this can provide valuable context when the reporter approaches the issue carefully. In this blog post about the use of antibiotics to treat children’s ear infections, however, the writer prioritizes her own experience and conclusions while ignoring important evidence and failing to seek out the perspective of any real expert. And so the story provides a lopsided and overly simplified account of an issue that demands more balanced coverage and careful consideration of benefits and harms. Read the CNN blog post for what we think is a fair comparison – blog to blog, head to head. This blog piece suggests that antibiotics are more effective than placebos for treating middle ear infections in infants and toddlers — a conclusion supported by two new randomized controlled trials reported in the respected New England Journal of Medicine. While useful to know, this information isn’t enough to tell us how all children with ear infections should be treated. To make these kinds of treatment choices, it’s also important to consider how much more effective antibiotics are than no treatment, and we should be aware that the benefits might depend on how confident the doctor is in the diagnosis (viral colds and other problems often look like ear infections, but won’t benefit from treatment). We also need to weigh the downsides of treatment, which include adverse effects such as diarrhea as well as the potential for increased risk of future infections with antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. After considering all of these factors, different parents may come to different decisions about whether they want to treat their child immediately with an antiobiotic or reserve treatment for a brief period while waiting to see if he gets better on his own. Reporters don’t do parents any favors when they encourage them to make knee jerk decisions about a child’s care, as this blog did.",False,True,False,0.1998589038848877

862,How optimism may help you live longer,"A story by CBS news plays up a new study in the American Journal of Epidemiology that could give anyone reason to feel optimistic: Optimism itself is linked to a longer life, at least based on a survey of professional nurses over the years. The survey used by the researchers was the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), which reaches out to tens of thousands of medical nurses every 2 years and asks them basic questions. The data is often used to help guide public policy. The story attempts to lay out the potential benefits of optimism and their relation to various diseases and longevity–but it did so using relative risk numbers, which are not reflective of the true impact. The story also missed an important discussion about how much the results could stem from having good health–that perhaps this causes the optimism, and not vice versa. Also, no independent sources–who could provide insight and some skepticism–were included. Most everyone on Earth wants to live longer, but we often have trouble picking the healthy behaviors that lead to longevity. If a sense of optimism — a totally cost-free medical intervention — could help encourage the right behaviors, extend lifespan, and improve the quality of life, that’d be a boon around the world. Unfortunately, it’s a devilishly tricky question to ask, given the strong counterargument: Maybe healthy people just feel more optimistic because they’re doing well, while sick or injured people have a lot more to worry about and feel more pessimistic.

871,Shots more effective than FluMist in adults,"First, we acknowledge that the version of the AP story that we found in the Charlotte Observer was less than half the length (327 words) of the AP story as we found it in other newspapers (734 words). So the reporter clearly did a lot more work than what was seen in the Charlotte paper. This is a troubling practice that we've written about elsewhere on the site. Nonetheless, the article accurately summarizes the availability of flu vaccines and the primary results of the new study in the New England Journal of Medicine — the proportion of children protected from the flu by each of two tested vaccines (i.e. the vaccines’ absolute efficacy). However, the story could provide more information to help readers judge the meaning of these results, the novelty of the “new” live, inhaled vaccine, its potential harms and costs, the overall quality of the research, potential conflicts among the story’s sources, and other health measures readers can take to prevent the flu. The AP report omits mention of costs—a significant feature of any major public health initiative. It’s unfortunate that the article fails to put the data on vaccine efficacy into a meaningful context. To begin with, the advantage of the killed vaccine shots over the live FluMist vaccine was not statistically significant. But the fact the shots were just as good as the inhaled vaccine was surprising. The researchers note that the main virus they were concerned about (type A) had changed or “drifted” from the strain that was in the vaccine. Earlier studies had led them to expect that the inactivated vaccine shots would be less effective in this situation. Instead, the shots and nasal spraywere very effective (74% each, according to the new study). The killed virus was also very effective against two strains of type B virus. More information on potential harms might also allay fears associated with live vaccines. Side effects described in the New England Journal of Medicine study were mostly minor–runny nose, headache, cough, and muscle aches among those receiving the live nasal spray vaccine and sore arms among those receiving the shots. The study authors attributed one serious complication to the live (nasal) vaccine—acute pericarditis, or inflammation around the heart and major vessels—a problem that required hospitalization. A little more information about the story’s sources would also help readers assess the new research. The story (as it appeared in the Charlotte paper) quotes a single university-based vaccine expert, but does not state whether he has any potential conflicts of interest. The story fails to note that two researchers received consulting fees from pharmaceutical companies–including MedImmune, which manufactures the FluMist inhaled vaccine in partnership with the researchers’ employer, the University of Michigan. Finally, the AP report misses an opportunity to explain other measures people can take to prevent the flu. In addition to vaccination, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend several (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/habits.htm). These include using antiviral drugs and good health habits (e.g. avoid close contact; stay home when sick, cover your mouth and nose; clean your hands; avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth). It would be unfortunate if readers took away the message that flu prevention is not very effective or that a shot (or snort) has little value for the healthier members of a flu-prone community. What did the reporter put in the longer version of his story that you didn't read in the Charlotte paper? Quotes from two other physician-researchers. Caveats about interpreting the study results. Information from another flu study that appeared in the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Information from an editorial in that journal. Information on the age groups approved for use of FluMist. Information on the number of flu deaths (36,000) and hospitalizations (200,000/yr.) from the flu. In other words, you missed a lot.

This story (along with those from many other news media outlets) should have addressed the glaring disconnect between what is recommended and what doctors and patients actually do.

On October 8, 2008, the FDA announced that they had cleared transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, for patients who had not responded to antidepressant therapy. However, because TMS is not an implantable device, the FDA was merely required to clear the device on the basis that it was """"safe and equivalent"""" to electro-shock therapy. The ruling does not claim that TMS is effective, and many questions remain about just how much benefit TMS provides compared to existing treatments.

The story does provide some quantification of benefits of TMS, describing what percentage of subjects scored significantly better on standard depression scores after treatment with TMS compared to sham. However, it was not clear from the story what """"significantly better"""" meant and if that translates into real clinical differences for the patient. The story mentions antidepressants and shock therapy but does not mention other very effective treatments for depression, including psychotherapy, either in combination with medication or by itself, and self-help techniques. Nor does the story explain that there are many different antidepressants and if a patient does not respond to one drug, other drugs can be tried before resorting to TMS. In addition, the story misrepresents shock therapy as a """"last resort"""" treatment. While shock therapy isn’t the first choice for many people, it could be a reasonable choice in certain clinical situation. Describing shock therapy in this way may be harmful to patients and families who are considering shock therapy at a time when it is likely to help. Furthermore, while the story describes the study and points out that the FDA had many concerns about it, the story does not describe what those concerns were. The story does explain that a new study should provide better data, but does not mention that this approval comes after a prior panel found insufficient evidence to support TMS. That the story focused only on the current study and FDA decision without putting it into context of the whole body of literature on the subject is problematic. Also, the story mentions that TMS was recently approved. However, the story should have emphasized that it is still considered experimental in spite of the approval and its availability is limited to a few research centers. Finally, the story quotes two experts who are both involved in the research on TMS in depression. The story should have quoted additional experts who do not have a stake in the outcome to provide some much needed balance. The story did not explicitly address whether the researchers had any financial conflict of interest.""",Misleading,True,False,0.2036747932434082

917,Teen Feels 'Hopeful' After Experimental Stem Cell Procedure on Damaged Heart,"This is a story about one young man receiving an experimental infusion of stem cells into his heart, to help with tissue scarring due to muscular dystrophy. Despite booming research around potential stem cell treatments for a wide range of conditions, the list of diseases for which stem cell therapy has been shown to be effective remains very short, according to the International Society for Stem Cell Research. Yet media outlets often put an optimistic spin on unproven stem cell therapies, as we’ve seen in our examinations of stories on heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe combined immunodeficiency, and multiple sclerosis. Showcasing a few preliminary cases with encouraging outcomes can exaggerate the potential benefits of a treatment and raise false hopes for patients. This story, based on a single case with an unknown outcome, fits this pattern. It fails to counter rosy statements by a physician and a patient with realistic assessments of the potential benefits and pitfalls of an unproven procedure for a fatal disease with no known cure. The story also lacks clinical details that would help readers get a true picture of the nature of the treatment, as well as a discussion of costs. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a heartbreaking disease that affects an estimated 1 in 3,600 boys as well as some girls. The most common inherited pediatric muscle disorder, it’s caused by a shortage of a protein called dystrophin, which leads to progressive muscle weakness. Most patients lose their ability to walk by age 12, and average life expectancy is about 25. Often patients die of heart failure because dystrophin deficiency leads to cardiomyopathy, a weakness of the heart muscle that makes the heart less able to pump blood and maintain a regular rhythm. A recent review of current therapies states that “only steroids have been shown to produce a slowing in the declining course of the disease.” Recent research has focused on using stem cells and gene therapy to create new, healthy muscle cells and thus halt or reverse the disease. The rapid advance and certain fatality of Duchenne muscular dystrophy has patients and their families desperate for new treatment options. Reporters have an obligation to those families to present stories in a reasonable and responsible fashion.",False,True,False,0.19938397407531738

In 2006, Plan B was made available without a prescription to women over the age of 18, however this ruling remains controversial and it is currently only available over-the-counter in 9 states (http://www.pharmacyaccess.org). EllaOne, a new drug currently only available in Europe, may be more effective at preventinging pregnancy than Levonorgestrel even when taken several days after uNPRotected sex or contraceptive failure. In a study published in the current issue of Lancet, women who took ellaOne within five days had a lower chance of pregnancy than those who took Levonorgestrel. In the study 1.8% got pregnant after taking ellaOne compared to 2.6% with Levonorgestrel. This story quotes two independent health experts who provide very valuable and balanced perspectives on the new study. The story could have been improved by describing the costs of the new drug compared to Levonorgestrel. Although the story mentions that ellaOne could cost up to three times as much as Levonorgestrel, this is not adequate information on costs. Most importantly, however, the story does the reader a disservice by not describing the harms and side effects of either option. In the study 19% experienced headaches and other common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea/vomiting, and cramps.

The research joins a growing number of studies of the effects of testosterone therapy that, together, constitute a mixed landscape of results. It’s unclear if this release will help readers navigate that landscape with more confidence. There’s nothing sensational or overblown about the description of the study or its findings, and there is substantial detail on the methodology and at least a hint toward limitations.

What we were looking for was a more clear-cut statement regarding what this study can and cannot tell us — specifically that it’s unclear if testosterone treatment or some other factor is responsible for the cardiovascular benefits that were observed by the researchers. We thought that would help clear up what can be a confusing topic for consumers. “Low-T” has been raised to the level of a health problem in American society, making it important to figure out if the merits of testosterone therapy actually do trump the debits.

923,Gastric Bypass May Help Obese Teens,"""The content of this television segment is generally accurate. A small study suggests that obese, diabetic teens can benefit significantly from gastric bypass surgery. It correctly says that this is an important finding for a condition that is serious and very hard to treat. It also indicates the surgery is controversial and its long-term effects unknown. But the story’s tone is excessively positive in a way the facts do not allow. The study’s flaws and limitations should have made the report more circumspect and restrained. The surgery group was very small, extremely obese and not well-matched to the controls. The study was retrospective and as a result fails to capture some key data. In addition, the surgery has serious side-effects that were not reported. The lack of data on long-term risks and benefits is mentioned as a small caveat, rather than a major gap in the research that leaves the most fundamental questions unanswered. The story’s most serious technical shortcoming is a failure to quantify the findings, which would have allowed people to appreciate how few teens were involved yet how many of them benefited. It would also have shown viewers how unusually obese the studied population was. The story illustrates how journalists may use unnecessarily loaded language to overdramatize findings. The segment uses the following words:     * dramatic (2)    * drastic    * radical    * remarkable    * huge    * dire    * life-threatening    * reversed    * disappeared    * vanished While some of these words may be accurate in context, the cumulative effect is to heighten hope and fear beyond what the facts permit.

924,UT Southwestern research shows 98 percent cure rate for prostate cancer using SBRT,"This news release draws from a Phasel/ll safety study of 91 patients who were given a concentrated form of higher-dose radiation known as stereotactic body radiation therapy, or SBRT, instead of typical radiation therapy for early-stage prostate cancer. The study was designed to test the toxicity of increasing levels of radiation, not to assess the survival rate. While the five-year study showed benefits, the release failed to provide the numbers and details that we believe would help readers understand the risks vs. benefits. The “cure” rate referred just to men who had no evidence of rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) — and the study acknowledges that most men were not actually followed for 5 years so a “cure rate” was statistically estimated. However, over a third of the men had low-risk cancer where the 5-year cancer-specific survival is estimated to be 100 percent. It’s not certain that these men actually required treatment. The National Cancer Institute estimates there will be about 180,890 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in the United States this year. Some of them will be treated with active surveillance, the “watch and wait” treatment. More aggressive cancers may require surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. Among those treated with radiation, stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT), an alternative form of radiation therapy described in this release, may offer a shorter course of treatment (five sessions) compared to external beam radiation therapy which is typically delivered over the course of about six weeks. The shorter SBRT approach suggests an important convenience benefit to patients.

The study also found that pregnant women who were hospitalized with severe flu were less likely to have been vaccinated, compared to women hospitalized with milder flu. The release covers some of the bases when explaining the study and benefits, but neglected to address potential harms that were noted in the published study and to provide needed context on the absolute risk of contracting serious influenza during early pregnancy and absolute rates of risk reductions. Influenza, or “the flu,” is a widespread disease in the United States. The CDC reports that about 40 million people in the U.S. got the flu during the 2014-15 flu season, of which 970,000 required hospitalization. And the health risks associated with flu are significant for pregnant women and their unborn children. As the CDC notes: “Changes in the immune system, heart, and lungs during pregnancy make pregnant women (and women up to two weeks postpartum) more prone to severe illness from flu, as well as to hospitalizations and even death. Pregnant women with flu also have a greater chance for serious problems for their unborn baby, including premature labor and delivery.” The research findings inform treatment and preventative care of an at-risk population — pregnant women — for a widespread and dangerous disease. That deserves our attention. At the same time, we expect experts to inform us about the true nature of the risks to pregnant women and their unborn children. The safety and effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating influenza remains a controversial topic within the medical community. Following an exhaustive review of the oseltamivir clinical trials (which it had to fight for years to obtain), the Cochrane Collaboration along with the British Medical Journal (BMJ) issued a report in 2014 that strongly questioned oseltamivir’s safety and effectiveness in combating influenza. “Initially thought to reduce hospitalisations and serious complications from influenza, the review highlights that Tamiflu is not proven to do this, and it also seems to lead to harmful effects that were not fully reported in the original publications,” wrote Cochrane editor-in-chief Dr. David Tovey, “This shows the importance of ensuring that trial data are transparent and accessible.”",Misleading,True,False,0.20863771438598633

However, that’s not the population that the researchers studied and reported on — the study results came from individuals known to have (or not have) cancer. The test’s ability to correctly identify cancer in a seemingly healthy population whose cancer status is unknown is an entirely different matter — and one that must be assessed in subsequent studies to determine how useful the test may or may not be for screening. Other concerns include the lack of cost information and no mention of the harms from possible false positives or negatives. While the release seems more targeted to potential investors than the general public we still encourage releases to include relevant information on benefits, potential harms and clear descriptions of the evidence. Lung cancer can be a vicious disease and many advanced cancer patients are given a poor prognosis. Part of the challenge of improving outcomes is earlier detection, so a potential blood test that could screen for the disease would be advantageous.

The story provides a lot of good details and explanations for the science behind the problem. Many sources were consulted for the story, and costs of the treatment were made clear. However, the story didn’t delve into the lack of research quite enough here–it posited one small, pilot study as fairly strong evidence that this method works. That may be the case, but that’s hard to know until more rigorous research is done, especially randomized research with a control group. The mixture of the reporter’s own positive impressions of the limited medical research behind this technique could leave readers believing there is substantial proof that it works. A few more cautionary details would have helped the piece on this front.",Misleading,False,False,0.19846796989440918
954,"Gastric bypass surgery cuts cancer risk, researchers say","This was a story reporting on presentation of data suggesting that an additional benefit that may be gleaned from having weight loss surgery is a reduced cancer risk. It failed to mention that the results reported on were part of an oral presentation and have therefore not been through adequate peer review and should be considered as preliminary. The story did include several quotes from experts in the field tempering the enthusiasm of some of the other quotes. The story devoted a lot of space describing study results about reductions in various cancer incidences that were statistically insignificant. Many readers will not understand the term ‘statistically insignificant’, especially when coupled with statements of relative risk reductions of 50, 60 or 70%. By presenting only relative – not absolute – risk, the story made the differences seems quite large when in reality they might be the difference of only one or two and certainly might be the result of chance rather than an effect of the procedures discussed. (Overall cancer cases were reported but were not broken down by cancer type. So we don’t know what a 70% reduction in pancreatic cancer, for example, really means.)",Misleading,False,False,0.19712066650390625
955,VITAMIN D: SUPPLEMENT LINKED TO WEIGHT LOSS IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE CHILDREN,"Newsweek covers the results of a preliminary study that suggest a weekly dose of vitamin D might help children with obesity. While the story provides important context to the issue, identifies some caveats, and includes the voice of an outside expert, some key details weren’t included. The study did not appear to control for things like daily activity levels (which can positively influence many aspects of health), and it covered a small population size with a limited geographic scope. Childhood obesity is a real problem, as the story points out, and a big one that affects more than 40 million kids under the age of 5 years. Life is short on simple and readily available fixes to major problems, so it makes for a compelling health story when scientific results hint at such a fix. But media outlets must be careful in covering rudimentary results, even if their competitors are doing so with abandon and generating great attention as a result. With this study, the results may or may not pan out after larger, longer, and more detailed studies are completed. And while taking vitamin D supplements on a weekly basis may seem innocuous, there are some risks. It’s also not hard to imagine that some readers may try to substitute it for more provably effective (yet more difficult) interventions — perhaps leading to secondary harm.",False,True,False,0.19669485092163086

It suggests possible benefit but that benefit may be because of physicians using their judgment to decide that sicker patients should not receive clopidogrel, so the improved survival observed in patients taking clopidogrel may simply be due to differences in how doctors selected patients for treatment or not. It is not clear if the study attempted to """"adjust"""" for differences in the study populations using statistical methods.

961,Novel 'patient-friendly' colonoscopy prep shows excellent efficacy and safety,"This release summarizes an investigational study on a ‘novel’ colonoscopy bowel preparation under development by a Massachusetts-based company. The release claims that the prep is a more palatable regimen that includes solid food bars and low-volume beverages. Researchers report that by the end of the Stage 2 clinical trial, the regimen was as safe and effective as two currently available colonoscopy prep formulations in cleaning out the colon, and, importantly, participating trial volunteers gave the preparation a high rating. The release did a good job of describing the study and quantifying benefits. The existing preps that the novel formulation was compared against were never mentioned and that seems an important omission. The release also didn’t provide enough details about harms, or a ballpark cost estimate, which it seems reasonable to expect in almost all news releases. The study was presented at the American College of Gastroenterology’s 2016 annual meeting. The standard bowel preparation and prolonged fasting required to ensure a clean viewing field for the gastroentologist is daunting and has been suggested as a limiting factor in acceptance. For those approaching the magic age,  Dave Barry’s 2009 article in the Miami Herald provides a humorous look at this screening procedure. But the reality is that colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and individuals should have a discussion about the benefits and risks of the procedure. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. Should the prep described in the release hold up throughout the clinical trial process, it may be welcomed by individuals facing a colonoscopy.",Misleading,True,False,0.19898033142089844

992,HPV Shot Prevents Genital Warts in Boys and Men,"This story shows many strengths, and wisely sets a single research report from the New England Journal of Medicine inside a larger debate about whether thousands of young men should receive the costly vaccine Gardasil. The story wades into discussions of sexual orientation and even at what age an individual knows this truth about him or herself. These difficult topics are germane to the epidemiology of the many human papillomaviruses, and which people of both sexes are at highest risk from infection. Bravo for reading the editorial that accompanied the study article, and chasing down its author on deadline to get her comments. Bravo for asking “why” when confronted with the seemingly contradictory news that Gardasil can prevent genital warts but is not recommended by the CDC for universal prevention in young men. Since Gardasil (and competitor, Cervarix) debuted a few years ago, there have been heated disagreements about the price and most helpful distribution of the vaccines and whether both sexes should receive them. This major study, demonstrating effectiveness in young men, adds important information to complex questions of cost and prevention. But it needs to be reported in a way that provides some of the history and context for readers. HPV infection is transmitted sexually, so questions of prevention within the entire US population of men and women involve potentially vaccinating both sexes. However, both sexes are not at the same level of risk for potentially deadly cancers years later. Women bear the brunt of the health risks, but men can pass the infection to their partners and can suffer from cancerous and non-cancerous effects of the virus.
