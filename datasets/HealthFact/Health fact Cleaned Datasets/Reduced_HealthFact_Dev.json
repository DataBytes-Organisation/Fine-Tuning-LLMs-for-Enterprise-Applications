{"claim_id":10330,"claim":"Cancer drug 49 times more potent than Cisplatin","explanation":"This University of Warwick release promises much more than it should, considering the research was conducted not on humans or even mice but on cell lines in labs. The release headline claims that a new compound called FY26 is “49 times more potent” than an existing chemotherapy, and a subhead says, “Effectiveness shown in tests on ovarian and bowel cancer.” But it’s a bit misleading to claim increased potency for a drug that’s never even been tested in humans, because the compound may not work the same way in humans as it does in a petri dish. The drug certainly faces a very long and uncertain road before it might be approved for use in actual cancer patients — something the release never warned readers about. This is interesting research that’s worth writing about, but the release desperately needed a statement cluing readers in to the very preliminary nature of the study. Millions of people with cancer are hoping for new therapies, and this release could set them up for false hope. The release promises that FY26 could be “cheaper to produce, less harmful to healthy cells than existing treatments and has been shown to be active against cancer cells which have become resistant to platinum-based drugs.” The release does not say that results from lab work will need to be tested for years before the therapy is proven safe and effective.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10295,"claim":"People With Mild Cognitive Impairment Should Exercise Twice a Week, Research Says","explanation":"This brief article in U.S. News & World Report discusses recently published professional guidelines for treating a condition of aging known as “mild cognitive impairment” (MCI) with regular moderate exercise. As the article itself notes, scientists and physicians “gush” endlessly about the benefits of exercise for seemingly everything, and now for MCI. However, the story didn’t make it clear that this recommendation is based upon just two studies, both short-term. Nor did it give us a sense of the scope of the benefits. Does exercise help a little? A lot? The rapidly growing numbers of people diagnosed with Alzheimer’s disease and other forms of dementia are clearly causes for genuine concern and even alarm in the United States. Beyond the human costs are the financial burdens on families and the overall health care system. And the persistent failure of hoped-for benefits from clinical trials of  drugs has added to the drumbeat of worry. As a consequence, those with symptoms of MCI (which may or may not be linked to the onset of actual AD or dementia), may turn to “alternative” interventions such as diets and dietary supplements, “brain training” with crossword puzzles, and exercise. Because exercise has been demonstrated to have specific and non-specific physical and psychological benefits for many people, it’s no surprise at all that guidelines from a respected journal suggesting that moderate regular exercise can improve memory would be of interest. But when the ability to summarize the precise impact of exercise is muted at best; and when the potential exists for “victim blaming” among those who fail to exercise, journalists should take great care in promoting such guidelines.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":10257,"claim":"Busting the vitamin C myth","explanation":"This report does a good job of using a recent, credible report to debunk the myth that taking vitamin C can prevent or treat colds. The segment uses its medium fairly well to deliver the key message. The piece has two major weaknesses. First, it fails to make clear the distinction between the benefits of vitamin C supplements and whole foods rich in the vitamin. More important is the overstatement the physician-journalist made about the possiblilty the vitamin itself can help prevent cancer. This is a major error that can mislead viewers about a very serious condition. (This problem is compounded at the end of the piece when the host says, \"I’m still taking vitamin C,\" without any challenge from the physician-journalist.) At the end of the piece, the host tells viewers that more information is available from its online partner, WebMD. This is commendable, a best practice in broadcast medical news. The WebMD article does indeed provide additional details about the Cochrane report that can help viewers understand the topic better.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10577,"claim":"Ultrasound Headset May Be New Way to Recognize Concussion on the Sidelines","explanation":"A Los Angeles-based company has found that its “advanced version” of a transcranial Doppler (TCD) device is able to pick up changes in blood flow in the brains of recently concussed athletes, potentially increasing the likelihood of a useful ultrasound device that can be available on the sidelines of sporting events to diagnose concussions in real time. The abstract of the study is being presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s annual meeting, and the association issued this news release as part of its conference outreach. The news release does an admirable job of explaining the experimental design that led to this finding, getting specific about the nature of the participants and using language understandable to lay audiences. Its omission of information about potential costs, harms and conflicts of interest is less ideal. Journalists, of course, will also need to be sensitive to the fact that the research has not yet undergone peer review. [Editor’s note: Kathlyn Stone, one of three reviewers on this news release, worked for the American Academy of Neurology from 2000-2004 as senior manager of media relations. She has no current relationship with the AAN.] According to the release, more than 1 million athletes in the United States sustain concussions each year. Detecting those “hits” early—ideally on the field of play—and determining which require medical intervention would be valuable. That being said, there really is no medical intervention to prevent sports-related concussion except to abstain from more contact. If the test were sensitive enough to detect early signs of concussion, it could prevent some additional damage that could result from continuing to play.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9426,"claim":"Antibiotics could dramatically reduce STIs, study says, raising tough new questions","explanation":"Getty Images This is a story about a test of using antibiotics right after sex to reduce the spread of sexually transmitted diseases in men who have sex with men and use no condoms. On the plus side, readers who stick with the story to the end are given many warnings from the researchers and independent sources about the risks of deploying such a strategy. In that respect this is a very thoroughly reported story. However, the story implies the results may be relevant to the general population even though the people included in the study have a risk of syphilis, for example, that is more then 1,000 times higher than the general population. All men in the study were also taking antiviral prophylaxis against HIV infection. Much of our concern about the story stems from the overly broad headline, and we’re the first to acknowledge that reporters often have little control over that key aspect of their work. Nevertheless, we think it’s something that needs to be addressed if readers are to receive an accurate picture of the research and its relevance. This is an important topic because rates of sexually transmitted infections remain high, especially among high-risk populations, and a safe and effective means of preventing them would be big news. News stories such as this, however, should be very clear about the potential relevance of studies to general readers. A more complete description of the study population (and of the long history of other studies that have looked at using antibiotics to prevent sexually transmitted diseases) would have helped readers understand just how specific and limited the results of this study are.","label":"MISLEADING"}

This matters because this is a non-drug treatment for certain headaches that can be very disabling.

In the case of \"new\" devices therefore, reader beware!","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":11574,"claim":"Blocking “rogue gene” may stop cancer spread: study","explanation":"It would set drug development speed records and defy all odds for a drug to enter clinical use within a decade after this sort of tentative laboratory experiment.

Scientists have every right to get excited when they find a new gene or make some advance that they believe holds promise for combating a particular disease. It is up to journalists to rein them in with careful analysis of the evidence and hard questions. This story offers neither. To the families who lose half a billion people every year to cancer in the United States alone, this is the kind of false hope that may cause more harm than good.","label":"false"}

Meili was given five years' probation for an incident in which an 11-year-old girl claimed he engaged in sexual intercourse with her (statutory rape) and in which he admitted to molesting her. Though not definitive, further evidence exists that could reasonably lead an observer to conclude that he committed statutory rape. What's false: Thompson's sentence was not based on his sale of marijuana but on the basis of a weapons charge, and his jail term was multiplied because he was already a thrice-convicted felon. Meili was not convicted of kidnapping the girl, and police statements suggest she voluntarily left her family home with him. Neither was Meili convicted of raping the girl.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":16025,"claim":"The Obama administration \"supported Muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard.","explanation":"Turley said that the Obama administration \"supported Muslim allies trying to establish a new international blasphemy standard.\" The accuracy of this statement hinges on how you understand that word \"supported.\" American diplomats did endorse a UN resolution that avoided words about restricting speech that defamed a religion, but left open the door to criminalizing speech that was \"incitement to immediate violence based on religion.\" The administration, as well as some free-speech advocacy groups, saw this as progress. But blasphemy laws remain on the books in Muslim nations, and the largest international body that speaks for those nations has said plainly that such laws are appropriate and ought to be adopted in the west. Not even Turley argues that this is the result the administration wanted, and another critic of the administration's strategy said American diplomats do not support efforts to establish an international blasphemy standard. One could argue that by participating in the ongoing negotiations, the administration has de facto endorsed a vehicle for the Muslim nations, but that is not the same as supporting their efforts. The statement contains an element of truth but ignores critical facts that would give a different impression.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":10756,"claim":"Hormone therapy raises risk quickly, study finds","explanation":"The focus of this story is a report of new data showing a statistically significant association between lobular breast cancer and short-term HRT (3 years or less). The story creates an exaggerated sense of risk because there is no mention of absolute risk. For breast cancer, estimated excess risk is 8 women\/10,000 women per year developing breast cancer after 4 years of combined HRT use as compared with no hormone use. A current treatment approach for bothersome menopausal symptoms is a course of low-dose HRT for 3-5 years with frequent monitoring. This course of treatment is considered safe for most women not already at high risk of developing breast cancer. The clinician interviewed stresses frequent monitoring and an individualized approach to managing symptoms. The story notes various combinations of hormone replacement therapy (HRT)  available for reducing menopaual symptoms, such as hot flashes and vaginal dryness. However, there is no discussion that menopause is a natural part of aging and unless symptoms are very bothersome, many women do not need to take HRT to ease symptoms common in menopause such as hot flashes, night sweats and vaginal dryness and discomfort. The story does strike a balance by interviewing the lead author of the study and a gynecologist who put the new information in clinical perspective. It would be helpful to hear from researchers of the Women’s Health Initiative for comment on how their data on breast cancer risk compared to the present study.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9415,"claim":"Sleep apnea patient finds rest with implant device: \"It saved my life","explanation":"Inspire Therapy implant The story focuses on one patient’s experience with a technology called Inspire, which is an implantable device used to treat one particular form of sleep apnea (obstructive). While sleep apnea is a common problem in the United States, the story does little to place the work in context. Instead, the story cites a medical professional who calls it “revolutionary” and a “game-changer” without telling readers that the doctor is a consultant for Inspire. There is also no objective medical assessment of the device’s effectiveness, as the medical professional quoted is also the treating physician. It’s also not clear why the story came out now, given that Inspire has been on the market for a few years and that the evidence cited is from 2014. We are happy for any patient who has found relief for a medical problem. But the treatment that works for one patient may not work or even be appropriate for others. It is important for any story about medical treatments to offer detailed information about the costs, risks and benefits of a treatment, rather than relying on one person’s story. This is true for any treatment, but especially for medical devices, which are not tightly regulated by the FDA. This story focuses on one person, but tells readers that Inspire “is offering hope for millions of patients with sleep apnea.” The story should let readers know whether that hope is justified, and also provide clarification regarding its potential benefit applies only to individuals with obstructive sleep apnea.","label":"false"}

The NBC coverage was focused on a cost-effectiveness study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

{"claim_id":9928,"claim":"Palliative Care Consults for Patients with Advanced Cancers Reduces Hospitalization and Improves Quality of Care","explanation":"This news release reports results of a study that found that patients with advanced cancers who were referred early to palliative care made better use of support services, including palliative chemotherapy, after being discharged and had fewer hospital re-admissions and invasive treatments. Researchers at Mount Sinai Hospital obtained their data through a prospective cohort study (one that follows a group of patients over time to observe specific outcomes). Unfortunately, the absolute numbers — readily available in the study — showing the results were not included in the news release. But the release does provide good context in other areas, particularly in explaining what palliative care is and what it entails for patients. In an era when ethical and economic issues surrounding end-of-life care loom increasingly large, this study addresses a critical issue. As the release points out, palliative care has positive implications for emotional and other quality of life issues for patients. In contrast, extensive time spent on acute-care hospital wards and intensive care units, or receiving invasive procedures, drives up costs and is frequently in conflict with patients’ explicitly expressed wishes. That being the case, it is all the more important that a news release about this issue provide the information readers need to judge the quality of the research method and put the results in context. As the authors of the journal article state: “Our findings are particularly important because multiple studies suggest that patients with advanced cancer often do not understand their actual prognosis or goals of chemotherapy; when they do not, these patients are more likely to receive nonbeneficial interventions, which contribute to increased suffering.” Many patients with advanced cancer are classic cases of those who receive too much care, which is of no benefit. Not only that, it adds to their pain, anxiety, and degrades their and their families quality of life. Its costs can be exorbitant, with some chemotherapy drugs costly upwards of $15,000 per month.","label":"MISLEADING"}

We also reviewed a news release about this research. Among the story’s strengths: It alerts readers that the study — presented as an abstract — has yet to be peer-reviewed and published, and it provides cautious comments from an independent source, although they appear at the very end. However, the story leaves readers in the dark about how the treatment was evaluated and what it costs, and misses some important limitations with the evidence. It largely ignored potential harms, including the possibility that some patients might be treated unnecessarily because the cause of back pain can be difficult to diagnose. Back pain is a common problem. Often it goes away with time and exercise.

{"claim_id":9891,"claim":"UNC Hearing Loss Experts Lead Clinical Trials of FDA-Approved Hearing Implant","explanation":"Synchrony EAS (electric acoustic stimulation) hearing implant. Image credit: Med-El USA, the device manufacturerThis news release from the University of North Carolina purports to advise journalists and the public about clinical research from the university that helped gain recent FDA approval for an implantable hearing device designed for adults with a form of moderate to severe hearing loss. But this news release is a not-very-thinly veiled infomercial for the device’s maker, and a promotional piece for and by the head of the university department whose faculty members clearly stand to benefit from marketing it. The release is full of hyperbolic praise for the device (“The technology is remarkable and so were the results…”) and the university’s role in the clinical trials. But it is very light on quantitative data and information about costs, complications and side effects that would help readers judge the pros and cons of an invasive cochlear implant. The release offers no links or references to published, peer-reviewed data; to the manufacturer’s website; or notes on potential conflicts of interest. There is some useful information about the prevalence of hearing loss in the U.S. and about what is novel about the implant. But this releases reads more like a commercial brochure than an informative and educational summary for public awareness. Hearing loss is indeed a significant and growing problem and a threat to an aging population. In recent years, hearing loss has been tied by research to cognitive loss (as described in this 2013 study published in JAMA Internal Medicine), as well as social isolation, traffic accidents and a host of other physical, emotional and social ills. Because Medicare, Medicaid and other insurers do not cover the cost of hearing aids — which can run into the thousands of dollars for state-of-the-art devices — most adults who need them don’t have them. For the most severe, disabling forms of “sensorineural”  hearing loss, cochlear implants can be life-changing, and the device described in this release could have novelty and benefits in addressing both high and low frequency hearing problems. Significantly, most insurance, including Medicare, covers the cost of the device and implant surgery. But the benefits of the implants come with risks, including the need for general anesthesia, damage to facial nerves, infections, tinnitus, and numbness. Adjustment to the devices can take months of habilitative services — and removal rates remain high in some populations. Long-term effects, moreover, still are largely unknown. For all these reasons, news releases and stories about surgical implants should offer context about the benefits, risks, costs and alternatives.","label":"false"}

The project was shut down, but it was the police commissioner, not the mayor, who officially closed the program.

The user who claimed credit for originating it racked up a grand total of only four posts and was not an established Reddit user. That user returned to update the original post twice, but the story and its subsequent repetitions were still based on a single, unverified Reddit thread from 2013 (which perhaps would have more aptly been posted to this subreddit).

Scott’s statement during the speech likely left  listeners with the impression that his investment in the environment in general is a record, and that would be misleading. Sorting out the total investment in environmental protection under Scott compared to predecessors is complicated because funding comes from state and federal sources and multiple state programs relate to the environment. However, under one way to compare funding - - the total for the Department of Environmental Protection -- Scott falls far short of Bush’s record. And Scott doesn’t beat Crist’s record, either.

{"claim_id":11367,"claim":"Drug effective in smoking cessation studies","explanation":"This news story was based on a report of two double-blind randomized studies comparing the newer drug, varenicline, with bupropion and placebo as aids to smoking cessation. This newer drug may help quell nicotine cravings by binding to receptors in the brain that control the release of dopamine, which is often stimulated by nicotine. More sustained levels of dopamine may help with cravings and withdrawal from nicotine. The studies discussed were both funded by Pfizer and reports of side effects were limited, as only nausea was listed and qualified as “mild” by the primary researcher. Despite the headline (“Drug effective in smoking cessation studies”), which we know is usually not written by the reporter, the journalists are appropriately cautious about the findings and provide information about the funding source and potential conflicts of interest. Abstinence rates at one year for each smoking cessation drug and placebo are presented; however, the news story lacks a comparison with abstinence rates for alternative (non-drug) methods of smoking cessation and does not provide enough information about the long-term risks of the newer drug or side effects. Longer-term data, larger controlled studies and more information on the safety of varenicline (vs. the more studied bupropion) are necessary before this drug is presented as a viable option for smoking cessation. Given that the drug has not yet been approved for smoking cessation in the U.S., the storyâ€™s generally positive tone fails to remind readers of hurdles still to be passed on the road to approval. For example, the drug’s performance is not much better than published rates for bupropion (Zyban) in other randomized clinical trials designed to test the latter versus placebo.","label":"MISLEADING"}

That’s why Williams’ team contends his stance didn’t shift when it didn’t offer the chance of parole to three individuals so far as it continues the process of reviewing 300 cases of juvenile lifers in Pennsylvania.

{"claim_id":9183,"claim":"Nonsurgical treatment can correct congenital ear malformations in infants","explanation":"Infant ear, before and after. Image: Becon Medical website The news release focuses on a recent journal article that evaluates the use of a nonsurgical treatment called the “EarWell system” to treat malformations of the ear in newborn infants. The news release reports that results were judged “good to excellent” for most patients in the retrospective study. However, the release poses some significant problems for readers. For example, the release doesn’t discuss cost and does not tell readers that the study co-author quoted extensively is the inventor of the EarWell system. The release also treats ear deformation and ear malformation interchangeably — a distinction made clearly in the relevant journal article. This is particularly important because the numbers discussed in the news release sometimes refer to patients with deformities and sometimes to patients with malformation. Ear malformations and ear deformations are not the same thing. As the journal article itself makes clear, “deformations are characterized by a misshapen but fully developed pinna [or external portion of the ear] with no missing skin or cartilage,” whereas “malformations demonstrate a partial absence of skin and\/or cartilage resulting in an underdeveloped pinna from an error in embryologic development.” The headline, section headline and first three paragraphs all refer solely to malformations. Deformity is mentioned for the first time in paragraph four, and in such a way as to make many (if not most) readers assume the terms deformity and malformation are interchangeable. But they’re not interchangeable. Here’s one reason that matters: the release later tells readers that “results were judged good to excellent in 97 percent of ears with one simple deformity.” And, based on the journal article, that’s true. But it wasn’t true for ear malformations — which is what the headline and opening paragraphs would lead readers to expect. Parents of newborn infants want to do what’s best for their children, and having to make medical decisions for their infants is a stressful and emotional ordeal. Those decisions can be particularly tricky when the medical decision to be treated is not life threatening. Confusing news releases do not help people make informed decisions under any circumstances, but that is particularly true in circumstances as fraught as those facing parents of a newborn.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9751,"claim":"Testing for more breast cancer genes offers useful information","explanation":"This story does a nice job of describing a recent study that looked at the clinical validity of several cancer genetic test panels. The study looked at a group of women who were very high risk for breast cancer but tested negative for the BRCA1\/2 genes and who were tested for other, potentially high-risk genes. It describes the potential harms associated with such test panels, touches on the authors’ reported conflicts of interest, and avoids disease mongering. It could have done better by specifying costs, interviewing independent experts, and by putting this evidence in context — explaining some general issues with genetic testing and their analytical as well as clinical validity. About 5-10% of breast cancer cases in the US are linked to hereditary genetic mutations, the two best-known mutations being BRCA1 and BRCA2. Mutations in dozens of other genes have been studied and identified as possible risk factors for breast cancer. Myriad Genetics owned a patent on these two tests until 2013, when the Supreme Court ruled that genes couldn’t be patented, thus invalidating their patents and their status as the only company that could offer BRCA1\/2 genetic testing. Since this ruling, other companies have begun to offer multiple genetic test panels that are now marketed to doctors and to patients alike. The main question behind these, and other (including non-cancer), genetic tests is what to do with the information generated by them. Are identified genetic mutations “clinically actionable”? Are the results meaningful enough to allow the medical team to alter or tailor clinical management? The availability of various panels of genetic tests, for cancer as well as for other diseases, has been controversial in the medical community. At issue are the “analytical validity” of the test (Can the test accurately detect whether a specific genetic variant is present or absent? ), as well as the “clinical validity” of the test (Can the test provide information about diagnosis, treatment, management, or prevention of a disease that will be helpful to a patient or to a consumer?)","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":11034,"claim":"Constant migraines may be from an unlikely culprit: a deviated septum","explanation":"This story advances the claims of a book author\/ear, nose and throat surgeon who says that many patients with migraines actually suffer from migraine-like headaches caused by a deviated septum in the nose. While the idea sounds reasonable enough, what’s lacking here is evidence. Most problematic is that the story unquestioningly passes along the author’s claim — based entirely on his own practice data — that he has a 90% success rate when treating headache patients with deviated septums. That’s a statistic that will probably help sell lots of books and drive more patients to the author’s practice, but we doubt it accurately reflects the benefits that the typical patient can expect from this treatment. Also troubling is the story’s failure to mention any possible harms associated with the surgery promoted in the book. Considering that septoplasty itself can provoke new chronic pain in some patients, this omission is particularly glaring. Migraine headaches can have a huge impact on people who suffer with them and  these patients may seek out multiple treatments in the hope of finding some relief. When evaluating these therapies, journalists need to go beyond sources who stand to gain financially from promoting them, including book authors.

The findings suggest that it can. But that’s a far cry from proving that this regrowth can function as normal brain tissue and, therefore, be “stroke-healing” in humans. Still, the news release is one of the better releases we’ve seen in terms of  making it clear that the study was in mice. Mice is referenced in the headline and throughout. Compared to many news releases we review that have to do with rodent research, this one was also more cautious with its language than most. A more substantial discussion of the harms and benefits of this experimental treatment would have made the release even stronger. This study is part of a growing body of research called “stroke neural repair,” referring to the  replacement of brain tissue damaged by a lack of blood flow, with new brain tissue. Although stroke is declining as a cause of death in the US, the fact that mortality from stroke is declining faster than the incidence, means we’re likely to see an increase in the number of people who become chronically disabled from the disease. That’s why there’s such intense interest in repairing brain tissue damaged from stroke. As further headway is made in this important area of research, some key questions for journalists and readers will be: is the new growth really functioning brain tissue? If so, how do we know it’s truly functional? And ultimately, the most difficult question of all, can it work in an integrated way with the rest of the brain?","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":11124,"claim":"Prostate Cancer Studies Find Benefit in Daily Acetaminophen and Brisk Walks","explanation":"Here’s some of what was missing in the story:  Not all prostate cancers are equal. So the acetaminophen\/aggressive cancer study – especially – required some perspective; Observational studies can’t prove cause and effect. So a headline that says “studies find benefit” is wrong. You can’t prove benefit when you can’t establish a causal link. There was no evaluation of the quality of the evidence. Without knowing the screening history and risk factor profile of the aceteminophen users, it is very difficult to interpret the observed association. Cancer progression is a very heterogeneous endpoint and the article did not address this issue or report meaningful results (absolute risk). There’s been a lot of prostate cancer news in the past two weeks, largely because the American Urological Association annual conference was just held.

We verified these instances by looking at Rauner’s current and former budget proposals, a vetoed bill and news stories. Rauner has proposed budgets that would eliminate funding in the areas Collins cites. But his 2015 veto of a bill that contained autism funding was in the context of rejecting 19 budget bills on the grounds that the entire package was unbalanced.

{"claim_id":11337,"claim":"Is it Brain Infection or Cancer? A New Rapid Test Could Hold the Answer","explanation":"This news release promotes a study in the journal PLoS ONE by researchers at Philadelphia University and Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. The crux: Even basic problems with the brain and other parts of the central nervous system, or CNS, are not only serious but also tough to diagnose — and especially so in rapid fashion. According to the release, a test that uses a little cerebrospinal fluid, or CNF, gathered from a patient’s spine might help doctors quickly narrow down whether they are dealing with an infection (by a virus, bacteria, or fungus) or some other issue, such as a demyelinating disease or cancer. The key to making this possible are cytokines — tiny proteins that cells release to sound the alarm to one another — and a device that can quickly test a small sample of CNF for dozens of different cytokines and their abundances. The release’s title does a decent job of not selling the moon, since it does not promise the “holy grail” of identifying a specific problem with one test — just the presence of an infection or something else. However, the teasing of a rapid doctor’s office-style test when one does not yet exist, and when the sample size is so small (43 people with a wide variety of issues participated) seems dubious — especially when one of its own authors says additional research is needed to confirm the core findings. It’s also important to highlight that this early data is a “retrospective analysis,” which means that even if the sample size of patients were bigger, it would only suggest that further prospective work needed to be done to validate the testing in patients. Problems with brains and spinal cords are often tough to diagnose. This is because infections by bacteria, fungi, and viruses can manifest similarly to other issues, like cancer or autoimmune diseases. The blood-brain barrier makes sampling the fluid that can hint at what’s going on tricky and painful — so making the most use of a sample is best. It’s especially key with the youngest patients, whose still-developing bodies and immature immune systems may not be prepared to handle major problems like encephalitis (inflammation of the brain)and also can’t describe their symptoms. If a one-stop test existed that could help doctors rapidly narrow down a long list of suspects for a CNS problem, it could save valuable time and financial resources, and potentially patients’ lives. If this test can be validated it could conceivably improve speed of diagnosis in order to get the most appropriate treatment.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":11154,"claim":"Prostate Cancer Drug Gets Lukewarm Review","explanation":"This story reports on an analysis done for the agency that oversees Medicare of the evidence of the effects of Provenge (sipuleucel-T) in certain men with advanced prostate cancer. It summarizes some of the conclusions and includes comments about how the analysis might influence a decision about whether Medicare and Medicaid will pay for the expensive new treatment. But the story leaves readers with the impression that the drug has been proven to extend the life of the average patient by about four months when actually there are many uncertainties about that estimate due to weaknesses in the clinical trials sponsored by the maker of the Provenge. The assessment done for Medicare underscores the questions that still need to be answered in order for doctors and patients to know whether and how to use Provenge, but that perspective is largely missing from this story. This story portrays debates about insurance coverage of Provenge as a matter of how much value to place on four months of life. But what the federal analysis of the Provenge trials actually focuses on is uncertainty about the amount of additional survival and questions about how other factors besides Provenge (including other treatments that were given to the trial participants) might have affected the trial results. Prostate cancer is the most common cancer occurring in men, though most tumors grow slowly and men diagnosed with the disease typically die of something other than their prostate cancer. Some tumors are aggressive and more effective treatments are needed for these cases. Provenge’s novel immunotherapy approach offers an attractive alternative to existing treatments, but the initial application for FDA approval was rejected in 2007. A new clinical trial was done and the treatment was approved for sale in the U.S. earlier this year. Although historically Medicare and Medicaid have covered treatments deemed safe and effective without considering the magnitude of the expected benefit, the limited additional survival and the high cost of Provenge treatment have highlighted debates about whether and how to consider these factors in deciding whether a particular treatment should be reimbursed.","label":"MISLEADING"}

The release neglects to point out that even after this phase 2 trial has been completed, researchers won’t know if the experimental drug cocktail is better or worse than standard treatments, because it does not include any direct comparison. The release puffs up the threat of multiple myeloma, which accounts for less than 2 percent of cancer cases in the US. It does not explain that patients would be responsible for many of the costs of this treatment, in part because of overlaps with standard care. The release does report support from pharmaceutical companies that make two of the drugs to be used. The lead investigator of this trial, Luciano Costa, MD, gave an interview in which he clearly pointed out much of the important information that is missing from the news release. The interview shows that the researchers are aware of the limitations of the evidence and of their trial. Costa pointed out that patients considering enrolling would be responsible for a share of the costs of treatment. Researchers have a responsibility to ensure that news releases issued about their work give readers a fair summary, not the kind of rosy depiction in this release.

In fact, there are several varieties of hormonal approaches used in prostate cancer treatment and this study found that different therapies were associated with different levels of heart disease risk, thus raising the possibility that refining treatment choices could minimize the concerns. The study was an observational review of heart disease among men being given hormonal therapies for prostate cancer. The story should have made clear that this type of study cannot establish cause-and-effect. What’s more, the study design appears to have serious limitations that are not addressed in the story. This last point highlights one hazard of reporting on presentations at medical meetings; unlike articles published in leading journals, meeting presentations do not undergo formal peer review.

{"claim_id":9066,"claim":"Landmark study may impact standard stroke treatment guidelines","explanation":"This news release from Emory University describes  findings of a randomized clinical trial that showed  positive outcomes among almost half of stroke patients whose brain blood clots were removed well outside the time frame of six hours currently recommended by stroke experts. The release properly discloses that the study was funded by a company that makes the clot removing device and quotes investigators from one of the participant investigators not at Emory. The release could have been stronger had it disclosed details about the patients (such as age, and their co-occurring conditions, race, gender); the size of the population of stroke victims in the U.S. likely to benefit from “late” clot removal; and limitations of the study (e.g. follow up was for 90 days, not long term). Some details on which stroke victims are considered eligible for clot removal within six to 24 hours and the costs of the clot removal procedure itself would have been helpful. Disability from stroke is a major cause of suffering and high health care costs in the United States and elsewhere, and despite advances in technology (clot removal devices) and clot-busting drugs, its prevention has long depended on how fast a stroke patient can make it to a hospital for treatment. The six-hour window long thought to be the maximum time in which clot removal technologies could save brains and lives has meant that individuals unlucky enough to have a stroke in remote locations, or in bad weather, for example, stood little chance of enough recovery to lead independent lives. Thus, the results of rigorous studies like the one described in the release — it was stopped early because of the positive outcomes — are exceptionally newsworthy, and important for the public to know about.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9259,"claim":"Asthma gene's effect on respiratory symptoms in infancy depends on breastfeeding status","explanation":"The release describes research into a possible link between breastfeeding and infants having a genetic predisposition to asthma. Researchers drew data from medical records on respiratory symptoms and breastfeeding status and compared them with genotype data gathered from study participants. It claims a 27 percent relative risk reduction among predisposed infants who were breastfed compared to those who weren’t, but we have no other data points, no absolute risk reduction information. The release doesn’t provide enough information for readers to be assured that other factors did not play a role in the results. Reviewers (and presumably other interested readers) were unable to access the actual research paper, or an abstract online, at the time of the review. [Editor’s note. Several days after reaching out to the issuing organization, an abstract on the study was provided, but it did not change the outcome of the review.] The relationship between genetic variance and environmental factors in the eventual development of asthma is not crystal clear. Asthma appears to have a strong genetic predisposition. A child with a parent with asthma is three-to-six times more likely to develop asthma than other children, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). If breastfeeding infants predisposed to asthma could actually reduce their risk of respiratory symptoms by a quarter or more, then that would be a substantial improvement, both to individual and to public health, especially given the growing proportion of children developing asthma and other respiratory problems.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":11269,"claim":"New Surgery to Treat Asthma","explanation":"This story is chock full of testimonials praising an asthma treatment that uses radio waves to zap troublesome lung tissue.

The story does a commendable job on many of our criteria, but then it stumbles on the fundamental question of how much of an advance the new treatment really is. It also fails to alert readers to financial ties between researchers and the company now marketing a bronchial thermoplasty device. When someone says a new treatment is better, it is imperative to ask, “Better than what?” By failing to tell readers that most of the people in the control group also improved during the key test of this asthma treatment device, this story paints an overly rosy view.

{"claim_id":9622,"claim":"Stem Cells May Safely Restore Motor Function In Patients Suffering From Disabilities After Stroke","explanation":"Drawn substantially from a feature-style news release issued by Stanford University’s School of Medicine, this story describes results of a trial in which modified human stem cells were injected into the brains of so-called “chronic” stroke patients. The results, which study authors called promising, showed the injections were safe. The stem cells–as expected–survived only briefly, but the researchers report that there were “clinically meaningful results” in which some patients (it’s unclear how many) recovered “significant” motor function. The story states the total number of patients (18), their age range (average age was 61), but it’s missing hard information about the range of specific improvements, along with any interviews from researchers independent of this study or medical center. An estimated 800,000 people in the U.S. experience an ischemic stroke each year, and most of them have permanent motor deficits unless treated with drugs within a few hours of the stroke. Given that this pilot safety study showed improvements in patients whose first-ever strokes occurred from six months to three years before treatment with mesenchymal stem cell injections, millions of people with stroke disability could potentially realize some restored function if the current research is borne out in further studies.","label":"MISLEADING"}

The trial randomized participants to either a series of exercise classes or to continuing their usual activities, so all it can say is that class participation appeared to offer benefits. As the researchers wrote in their journal article, they could “only speculate on the factors responsible.”   On a side note, the New York Times may want to claim credit for a huge scoop on reporting about the potential benefits of this type of exercising to music.

{"claim_id":9151,"claim":"Non-surgical weight-loss treatment found safe, effective for those with limited options","explanation":"More information on potential harms and availability would have made this news release on three medical interventions for weight loss stronger. And addressing the need to complement the procedures with other lifestyle changes would have made the release much stronger. The news release addresses study findings related to the relative success of endoscopic sleeve gastroplasty (ESG) — in which the stomach is sutured via a tool introduced through the mouth — as a less invasive, non-surgical alternative to facilitate weight loss in obese patients. We disagree with the release’s use of the term “non-surgical” to describe the procedure since it involves internal cutting and suturing of internal organs. However, the release does a good job of addressing cost and comparing the outcomes of various procedures. According to the NIH, 35.7 percent of U.S. adults are obese — and obesity increases an individual’s risk for heart disease, stroke, diabetes and other health problems. On top of those health risks, obesity also has an adverse effect on an individual’s quality of life. Patients with obesity may view medical procedures, such as ESG, as effective ways of helping them lose weight — and a study that compares costs and outcomes of several procedures is a useful means of helping patients consider their options. For the most part, the release does a good job here. However, additional insight on the lifestyle choices needed in conjunction with the procedures, and more information on potential harms, would have offered a fuller overview for readers.","label":"MISLEADING"}

It summarizes the treatment’s apparent benefits and potential harms, as well as ethical concerns about exporting research on dangerous treatments to countries such as Brazil where patients may not fully understand the risks. If the broadcast has a weakness, it is that it fails to mention the limitations inherent in any small, nonrandomized, nonblinded study with short follow-up that investigates a new treatment in patients with a chronic disease requiring lifelong care.

Even if the treatments were relatively safe and conducted in the U.S., viewers should understand that such studies are awash in potential biases and should always be approached with caution.","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":9516,"claim":"CAR-T therapy makes early inroads in treating brain cancer","explanation":"This story in STAT, like the one in TIME.com that we also reviewed, describes the successful, and apparently first positive response of a glioblastoma brain tumor to CAR-T therapy. This is an experimental immunotherapy that depends on on injections of modified immune cell proteins and that has had a few successes in blood cancers but essentially none in solid tumors, including those in the brain. Described in a report in the The New England Journal of Medicine, the study was conducted and promoted by officials and physicians at the City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and Medical Center, an organization that has a somewhat unfortunate history of touting treatments as bringing about “miracles” and encouraging coverage of compelling individual cancer patient stories to support sometimes exaggerated claims of major advances in cancer treatment. This STAT story does a better job than TIME of putting what is essentially a single, unexpected experimental result into perspective. Its strongest points are that it avoids touting this one patient’s experience as any kind of broad “success,” calling it an “early inroad;’ emphasizing its “notorious” potential side effects; and most of all quoting sources outside City of Hope who made clear that, as one put it, the success was possibly a “flash in the pan.” Bravo. One thing that would have made the story stronger? Early on emphasizing how a single case study makes for weak evidence. See our six tips for writing accurately about cancer immunotherapy drugs. Unlike the TIME story (see our review), this story included important voices of caution to help keep expectations in check. Starting with the headline, readers of this story are likely to come away with a more realistic perspective on this treatment.

{"claim_id":10580,"claim":"Fewer mammograms means more breast cancer deaths","explanation":"This broadcast describes data from two recent government reports showing that fewer women are undergoing mammograms and fewer mammography centers are in business today than a few years ago. It quotes one expert who says this means that more women will therefore die of breast cancer. Few would argue that all women should have access to mammography. However, the broadcast provides no evidence to support the dire conclusion of the expert that more deaths will ensue. It also fails to balance this view with information about the potential harms of mammography. And it neglects to note that the GAO report says that current capacity is “likely adequate.”  What is the quality of evidence on this complex topic? There is no way to tell from the broadcast whether the scientific evidence supports the view that fewer mammograms will categorically result in more cancer deaths, nor any attempt to weigh this against the evidence that mammography may produce harms as well as benefits. Most experts believe that mammography in women aged 50 to 69 saves lives; its benefit in those younger and older is controversial. But like other cancer screens, improved survival among women who undergo mammography may be deceiving. It is possible, for example, that screened patients do not actually live longer than unscreened patients do, but simply appear to live longer because they receive a diagnosis earlier. It is also possible that mammography will actually cause harm. Exposure to radiation during mammography could itself cause breast cancer 10 or 20 years down the road. (Br J Cancer 2005;93:590-6. Lancet 2000;355:1757-70) In addition, mammograms increase the diagnosis of lesions. Left untreated, some of these will become cancers, but many will not. The discovery of a lesion leads not only to fear and anxiety, but also to invasive diagnostic tests and invasive treatments (including mastectomy or lumpectomy) that inflict additional emotional and physical harm. “For every woman who has her life extended by screening,” writes the Cochrane Center’s Peter Gotzsche in Denmark, “there are at least five women who will be diagnosed with, and treated for, cancer unnecessarily.” (Lancet 2005;366;1519-20) One learns nothing about these potential harms in the ABC News broadcast. Because medicine does not yet have perfect estimates of the harms of mammography, some would say there is no simple “right” recommendation for every patient. The only possible blanket recommendation might be for clinicians–and the news media–to explain the potential benefits and harms, and thus help women to evaluate their own individual tolerance for risk and preferences so that they can choose the course of action that best suits them. News organizations that choose to cover medicine should explain the quality of the evidence and the pros and cons surrounding any medical procedure well enough for patients to understand what is known and what remains unknown. Unfortunately, instead of an even-handed analysis, this broadcast promotes fear.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9169,"claim":"Magnetic brain stimulation causes weight loss by making gut bacteria healthier","explanation":"The focus of this news release from The Endocrine Society is on research examining the impact of deep transcranial magnetic stimulation (dTMS) — a non-invasive treatment that can stimulate different regions of the brain — on weight loss, hormones and signaling molecules that can affect metabolism and appetite, and composition of the gut microbiome in 14 obese human subjects living in Italy. Microbiome refers to the community of microorganisms living in and on our bodies, most of which are within the gut, and their genetic makeup. The results indicated that volunteers who underwent dTMS lost more weight and fat mass than those who had a sham procedure and that changes were seen in the microbiome profile in individuals who’d had dTMS. The release didn’t discuss any changes in the sham group, and there was no discussion of where these results fit within the total body of evidence in this area of research. Most importantly, the release takes significant liberties by stating that dTMS can directly impact microbes living in the gut, without considering the impact that weight loss and lifestyle changes have on microbial composition. Employing a more cautious interpretation of the results, and including a discussion of costs, risks, and comparisons to other weight loss treatments would have significantly improved the release. Researchers and clinicians work relentlessly every day to find treatments for obesity and its chronic health consequences, and yet, new, safe and effective techniques are few and far between. It’s well known that obesity treatment and management are critical concerns in the United States and abroad. Any new technique that might influence weight loss, appetite, or the gut microbiome is exciting to consider, given that lifestyle changes and prescription weight loss drugs often have limited long-term impacts. However, this news release overstates and oversimplifies the results of the study without fully addressing the complex interplay between weight loss, metabolic hormones and neurotransmitters (the brain’s chemical messengers), and the microbes living in our gut. Change in one of these components typically doesn’t proceed without the others, and the mechanisms are extremely intricate and multifaceted. This release seems to leap from Point A to Point C in a conclusion that does not show appropriate and cautious interpretation of the results of this very small study.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":11009,"claim":"Bioidentical hormones for menopausal symptoms","explanation":"Bio-identical hormone therapy is a poorly-defined term for using a set of hormones that are molecularly identical to natural hormones in the body. Proponents of this treatment claim that bio-identical hormones are safer and more effective than conventional hormone therapy for treating the symptoms of menopause, however there is no evidence to support these claims. Furthermore, hormones are expected to have the same risk and benefits as approved drugs for which there is an evidence base as well as extensive research and regulation. Many medical organizations, both in the US and internationally, have issued statements raising concerns about the claims made about bio-identical hormones. This story does a good job of raising awareness about this issue, although it should have noted that many women don’t experience symptoms in the same way and that treatment with bio-identical hormones or traditional hormones should only be used by women who are bothered by their symptoms and not if they are trying to prevent heart disease. The story could have been greatly improved by coming down harder on the proponents of bio-identical hormones. While the story includes a debate on whether there is evidence to support the use of bio-identical hormones, in doing so, it gives the impression that there really is a debate. Bio-identical hormone supporters claim that there have been dozens of clinical trials showing a benefit. However, a 2007 systematic review found \"a dearth of scientific evidence to support these claims\". The story should have been more critical of the evidence base to support the use of bio-identical hormones. This is a subject sure to attract attention, given the wide range of troublesome symptoms experienced by many women during the menopausal transition. It is important for women to be aware of the potential risks of uNPRoven therapies, including bioidentical hormone preparations, that may be \"prescribed\" by alternative health clinics.","label":"MISLEADING"}

It may help readers to see that statin use is a choice and that consumers should understand both the benefits and potential harms that may be associated with whatever pills they decide to take.

{"claim_id":11414,"claim":"Avastin Largely Safe for Patients With Type of Advanced Lung Cancer","explanation":"This is a story reporting on a study which reported on the potential harms associated with the addition of the drug Avastin in patients with an advanced form of a specific type of lung cancer. What the study showed and was reported in this story was that there were several individuals who experienced bleeding complications with Avastin added to their treatment. The piece fails to indicate what benefit patients might hope to expect from the addition of this drug to their other treatment regimens. Although the story was clear about the potential harms associated with this drug, it seems a little odd not to more fully explain that it is not yet known whether the drug will be helpful to patients with metastatic non-squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer – especially since the FDA announced this week that this drug does not demonstrate benefit when used to treat breast cancer. In the absence of information about the benefits, it is not possible to weigh the risk of harm against the potential for benefit. This is an issue that should have been addressed in this story. The timing of this story is curious but probably coincidental – to a degree. The big news about the drug Avastin is that the FDA has decided not to approve it for use in treating breast cancer because it does not improve survival or delay disease progression. While this did receive one line in the story, instead of hyping the potential for use of this particular in lung cancer, the space might have better used to examine what are the expectations for a drug used to treat a metastatic cancer. Drugs need to be not only safe, but also affective in order to add value to a treatment regimen. So while we know the story was based on a journal article released this week, it is the editorial decision to report on this rather mixed bag finding that is curious. And while we applaud news coverage of Phase 4 trials, are all Phase 4 trials (or the relative paucity of same?) going to be reported consistently?","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10501,"claim":"Certain foods may be the best medicine for lowering ‘bad’ cholesterol","explanation":"This story was about a study comparing a special vegetarian diet containing a “portfolio” of cholesterol-lowering foods (e.g. nuts, soy, margarines fortified with plant sterols) with standard dietary advice for preventing heart disease (e.g. cut out saturated fat). There was plenty to like about this story, including comments from two excellent independent sources which added valuable context to the piece. The story also makes the very important point that this study looked only at a surrogate marker of heart disease risk, LDL cholesterol, and not actual heart disease outcomes. But the story didn’t provide crucial information about costs or availability of the diet components and it didn’t fairly describe how difficult it would be for most people to maintain this kind of diet. These mistakes are compounded by a glaring misinterpretation of the study which is trumpeted in the headline — i.e. that the diet tested in the study lowered LDL cholesterol “more than statin drugs.”  Many people at risk of heart disease don’t want to take cholesterol-lowering drugs, can’t take them because of troubling side effects, or don’t achieve their targets on drug therapy alone. Others may have cholesterol levels above target but below the range where statin therapy is indicated.

First of all, lawmakers signed off on in-state tuition for undocumented students in 2001--before Dewhurst became lieutenant governor--while the 2005 legislation cited by Patrick largely left the 2001 law intact while focusing on all students getting in-state tuition even if parents move out of state. The proposal regarding free health care for illegal immigrants didn’t launch a program for immigrants, which is what Patrick’s statement seems to suggest. Rather, local governing bodies were permitted to provide (or, it appears, resume providing) non-emergency services to residents regardless of immigration status, an action projected to improve outcomes and head off costly emergency care to which all residents were already entitled per federal law. The Senate proposal also envisioned patients sharing costs.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9688,"claim":"School water coolers may help kids lose weight","explanation":"Despite it being a fairly short report, CBS covers a lot of ground: it quantifies the benefits in absolute terms, outlines the study design and weighs the advantages of modern water dispensers against “old-fashioned” water fountains. But in other areas, the story falls short. There is no mention of costs and of study limitations. Although it quotes from the accompanying JAMA Pediatrics editorial, the CBS story doesn’t feature any critical perspectives on the study. We would have liked a closer look at some of the study’s shortcomings, which could have been achieved by comments from an independent source, or someone who was not involved in the study. More context on where this study fits in “the growing body of evidence” would have also been welcome. Finally, word choice could have been better. CBS refers to the JAMA editorial and writes that “the study’s findings are significant.” However, “statistically significant” has a different meaning than what the public believes is “significant.” The distinction should be clear, or another word should be used. Childhood obesity is a health concern that is on the minds of many parents and policymakers. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) estimates childhood obesity has more than doubled in children and quadrupled in adolescents in the past 30 years. In 2012, more than one third of children and adolescents were overweight or obese, the CDC said. And compared to other countries around the world, the US comes out on top when it comes to obesity among adults, according to a 2014 OECD report. There are even speculations that high obesity rates may cause life expectancy in the US to decline. Therefore, any efforts to curb the “obesity epidemic” in America is newsworthy, especially if the intervention is low cost, low risk and for children.","label":"true"}

Given the nature of the research–unpublished and coming directly from a pharmaceutical company–an outside source would have made this story stronger. (We also reviewed the news release this story seems to be based on.) The worldwide occurrence of diabetes is about 400 million people, 90 percent of whom have type II diabetes. Many of these people eventually have to supplement their oral medications with injected insulin.

{"claim_id":10976,"claim":"Acupuncture Benefit Seen in Pregnancy","explanation":"This story adequately describes the current study and provides the appropriate caveats to interpreting its results. The story could have been improved in the following ways: 1. By providing more detail on the specially-designed type of acupuncture used in one arm of the study. Where could a woman seeking this treatment find it? How many practitioners are trained on this regimen? 2. By mentioning any harms of the treatment. While acupuncture is very safe, the study did report some pain and bleeding. 3. By seeking the perspective of an independent expert and not simply quoting the lead author of the study. 4. By describing the costs or insurance coverage for acupuncture. Because insurance coverage for acupuncture varies widely, out-of-pocket expenses for the 12-session regimen could be a substantial barrier to many women seeking treatment. Interviewing only the lead author may provide an incomplete perspective of the significance of the findings.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9092,"claim":"New research to treat acute malnutrition","explanation":"This news release describes a study published in PLOS Medicine, showing that among moderate acute malnourished infants lipid-based nutrient supplement (LNS)–a kind of fortified peanut butter–produced more gain in muscle and organ weight over 12 weeks than a corn-soy blend (CSB) porridge. Acute malnutrition affects over 50 million children across the world. It is characterized by bodily wasting following experience of a recent period of starvation. According to the researchers, until now there has been concern that because LNS has a very high fat content any weight gain it produced would be composed primarily of fat. The distinction of this study is its demonstration that LNS not only resulted in more weight gain, but that weight gain was in muscles and organs (lean mass) rather than fat. Children with the most severe level of acute malnutrition are at risk of death. Increasing the effectiveness of interventions with children before their malnutrition becomes severe could save millions of lives. However, readers would take away a better understanding of this critical issue if more space in this news release had been devoted to explaining the study itself, and less to citing various researchers and partners about how important the project was.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":11375,"claim":"Getting the focus back: There’s new hope for people with age-related macular degeneration","explanation":"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a significant cause of blindness in the elderly and is becoming more common as the population ages. There are two major kinds of AMD, \"wet\" or neovascular and \"dry.\" Although the \"wet\" form is much less common than \"dry\", it is much more likely to lead to blindness, which can occur very suddenly. Until recently, wet AMD was treated with lasers or phototherapy, however in June, 2006 the FDA approved the drug Lucentis for the condition. This story reports on advancements in treatment of AMD but then goes on to talk about developments in treating cataracts, diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma. This review will focus on the discussion of treating wet AMD with Lucentis, which comprises the first five paragraphs of this story. By not exaggerating the seriousness of wet AMD, the story avoids disease mongering. The story should have provided some sense of the prevalence of wet AMD, which is relatively rare compared to the more common dry AMD. The story mentions Avastin, laser treatment, and phototherapy as alternatives. The story could have provided more information on the advantages and disadvantages of the different approaches. The story does mention the increased risk of strokes with Lucentis, however the story should have also mentioned risk of inflammation and infection from injection into the eye. The story does not mention the cost of Lucentis, which is substantial, up to $2000 per injection. Since the injections need to be given monthly for an indefinite amount of time, cost is a major issue and has the potential to be a signficant barrier to obtaining the drug. The story does mention that Avastin is a much cheaper alternative, but this is not enough information on the cost of treatment. The story does not adequately describe the strength of the available evidence, nor does it quantify the benefits of Lucentis. Finally, the story only quotes one expert and one satisfied patient who happens to be a physician. The story should have quoted other clinicians\/researchers who could have provided some additional perspective.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9299,"claim":"New Data Shows Irreversible Electroporation Nearly Doubles Overall Survival of Patients with Locally Advanced Pancreatic Cancer When Added to Standard Therapy","explanation":"A futuristic-sounding medical treatment is paired with a bold claim of survival benefit in this news release. But the release is missing basic information to back up the headline’s claims and put the treatment’s efficacy into perspective. And an important conflict of interest is not disclosed. Such omissions could help instill false hope in sufferers of pancreatic cancer and their families. [Editor’s note: At the top of this review, we’ve left blank the area where we’d normally put the logo for the organization that issued this new release. This reflects our uncertainty as to who should be considered the source of this news. As we’ve discussed in a blog post, the release is worded to suggest that it originated with the University of Louisville, and it includes a University of Louisville media contact. However, that contact has told us, via email and a comment on this review, that the release originated with MCS Healthcare Public Relations, which was working with a member of the University of Louisville faculty. That faculty member, in turn, suggested to us that the release was in fact cleared and sanctioned by the University. The University of Louisville media contact has refused to provide any further clarification. We’re unsure whom to believe, so we’ve deliberately left blank the area where we’d normally indicate the news release source. The fact that we can’t even tell where this news came from should raise questions about the process that produced it.] Pancreatic cancer is one of the most aggressive forms of cancer, killing nearly three-quarters of victims within a year of diagnosis and about 94 percent within five years. One reason, according to the CDC, is that nearly 80 percent of patients are diagnosed too late for surgery (which can extend median survival by about 10 months). Thus any treatment shown to be effective in treating the disease–especially a minimally invasive, non-surgical method–could possibly reduce patients’ suffering and provide them significantly more quality time with their loved ones.","label":"false"}

In reality, ISIS is using a vast array of tactics to persuade people to give up their lives for their fight. No expert would say that someone would join ISIS for the reasons isolated on CNN.

{"claim_id":9000,"claim":"UTA researcher patents “roach motel” for cancer","explanation":"This news release announces the European patent for a medical device that is designed to attract, trap and kill cancer cells. Ostensibly, the device could be used to detect early signs of metastasis in various forms of cancer, and potentially could find use in cancer treatment. However, the device’s utility at this point appears to be largely hypothetical. The release indicates that no clinical trials have been done; offers no information on benefits (or health risks) associated with such a device; and says nothing about the potential costs associated with such a device. Indeed, the release does not tell readers anything about the research that underlies the device. Based on the information in the release, the device appears to be — at this point — little more than a concept. As the National Cancer Institute notes, “Cancer has a major impact on society in the United States and across the world.” Indeed, cancers claim the lives of hundreds of thousands of people each year in the United States alone. With that in mind, it is important to be cautious when announcing a new tool that “can be used for early diagnosis and treatment of metastasized cancer.” To be more specific, one should at the very least be prepared to provide meaningful information to support the claim. Securing a patent may be valuable — both financially and for the public good — but that value can only be realized if the relevant technology can be used in a clinical setting. This release offers more questions than answers, with the foremost question being: will the device work in people?","label":"false"}

The term ‘anti-aging’ is a misnomer, as there are no proven medical interventions to stop or reverse the process of aging. Federal law states that distributing or administering human growth hormone for age-related health problems or for cosmetic use is illegal. Growth hormone is currently only approved for adults with Growth Hormone Deficiency (GHD) and for children with pituitary disorders. The promotion of growth hormone to counteract the effects of aging, namely a decline in physical functioning, is not new; however, the benefit of this use has not been established and the long-term safety is unknown. In this randomized controlled study, an increase in physical functioning was reported in the growth hormone group, but we are not told the degree of this benefit, or if the difference in functioning (measured by improved balance, climbing stairs and heel-to-toe walking) between this group and the placebo group was statistically significant. This story notes that diet and exercise are preferred methods of prevention for staying healthy and functional as we age. However, the story focuses on the notion that normal physical decline involved with aging needs to be counteracted with a pill, such as growth hormone. The natural decline in growth hormones with age may actually be protective. The comparison of prescription eye-glasses for older adults with taking growth hormone to improve physical functioning is unfounded and qualifies as disease mongering. Eyeglasses are an intervention to improve a manifestation of aging, i.e. degenerating eyesight, and glasses pose few (if any) risks to physical health. Growth hormone may pose serious risks to the endocrine and cardiovascular systems, and long-term use may actually reduce longevity by increasing the risk of prostate cancer in older men. The only sources of information appear to be researchers who presented their work at a scientific meeting. (There can be problems with such reporting. See “Media reporting on research presented at scientific meetings: more caution needed,” at: http:\/\/www.mja.com.au\/public\/issues\/184_11_050606\/wol10024_fm.html) The story does note that the study was sponsored by Pfizer, maker of the growth hormone drug capromorelin, but there is no independent reporting or corroboration with sources not affiliated with the study.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":10320,"claim":"Shot Might One Day Help Lower Cholesterol","explanation":"We liked that this story was cautious about predicting whether or how an experimental new cholesterol-lowering drug called AMG 145 might be useful for preventing heart disease. But there were a few missed opportunities to provide additional context, particularly regarding the cost of the new drug (which will likely be very high) should it ever make it to market and the fact that the outcome measured in this study (LDL cholesterol) is only a marker of heart disease risk that may not reflect a reduction in actual heart attacks. As this story points out, there are many factors which can make it difficult for patients to take cholesterol-lowering statin medication. Some patients are troubled by statin-related muscle pain, while others simply aren’t disciplined enough to take their daily dose of medicine as directed. Other patients may never achieve their target for LDL cholesterol reduction despite taking the highest available statin dose. An alternative drug that lowers cholesterol with less frequent dosing and with the potential for less risk of muscle pain might be useful for these patients.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":11558,"claim":"Less Radiation OK for Breast Cancer","explanation":"The story reports on a study of shorter course of radiation therapy for women with early stage breast cancer . Results of this study were presented at the recent American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting and have not been published in a peer-reviewed journal. (The limitations of interpreting such findings could have been emphasized.) The story notes that more long-term data may be needed to determine the safety and effectiveness of the shorter course of radiation treatment. The story notes that this shorter course treatment is for women who have cancer confined to the breast. The story lists some options for radiation treatment following breast cancer surgery; however, it does not mention partial breast radiation and other alternatives to traditional radiation currently being tested. The story describes the study and provides recurrence rates at 5 years – from 2-5% in all groups. We are told that doctors \"believe the treatments are equivalent\", but \"cannot say so with certainty\", meaning in lay terms the difference was not statistically significant. It is important to note that this is a large study, which is good, but we do not know well it translates (e.g. what size tumors did these women have, what was the margin status, what type of systemic therapy). It would be good to note that results controlled for all these other factors. More data on side effects in the groups would also be useful. The story does list some of the side effects of radiation, namely skin and breast tissue changes, and notes these were less common in women who had a shorter course of radiation. Fatigue is also a common side effect of radiation, but this is not mentioned. Time, energy and the expense of travelling to more radiation treatments may influence a women’s decision for breast cancer surgery. The story does not list the cost of radiation treatments; however, what is really at stake here is time lost from work or other activities. All of these may play into a woman’s decision to forego radiation or to have a mastectomy vs. lumpectomy with radiation.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":9379,"claim":"Overcoming Fear of Back Pain May Spur Recovery","explanation":"This article, based on findings of a small study of people with chronic back pain in Belgium reported in the journal JAMA Neurology, tells readers that if they can only “think differently” and stop “fearing” their pain, such attitude changes combined with “cognition-targeted motor control training” does significantly more than standard physical therapy and back pain “education” to reduce the pain and increase ability to function. The problem is that the story doesn’t really explain the differences between the standard and experimental therapies, the latter of which is composed of a sort of physical “desensitization” to feared physical movements; and fails to offer any details about the base level of the subjects’ pain, how pain was measured, or why the researchers looked for (and didn’t find) brain changes in the study group. We were glad the article included an outside expert, who makes clear that the experimental intervention is time intensive, costly, not covered by insurance and  — although “promising” — still unproven with respect to long-term benefit compared to standard therapies. That provided some much needed information for the reader. (Note: Due to an editing error, this story originally was marked with a 2-star score. It has been updated to reflect the correct rating of 3 stars.) This study focuses on behavioral and educational approaches designed to reframe how patients think about their pain. By emphasizing that “hurt doesn’t mean harm,” the hope is that patients will become more active and that activity may actually reduce pain. This “pain catastrophizing” theory is not really new. As such the description of this study doesn’t make clear what is different from prior studies evaluating this approach. Nonetheless, such efforts are important and need to be replicated in larger studies, so were glad the story ended on that note.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9532,"claim":"Allergy treatments enter a new era — with a focus on stopping reactions before they start","explanation":"The headline on this story from STAT promises to highlight a “new era” in allergy treatment built around the idea of preventing histamine and other immunologic explosions in our bodies’ mast cells and basophils before they start. What it delivers is something less–updates on efforts at immunologic therapies that are way short of popping up at the pharmacy anytime soon–and more: an eye-opening look at how Big Pharma and Big Science are investing Big Money in a potentially huge worldwide market for treatments that probably won’t do much better than antihistamines, epinephrine and allergen-avoidance. Parents curious about these forthcoming treatments–including very pricey immunotherapies–are likely already wondering if they’ll be affordable, yet the story skirts any discussion of pricing. But readers who stick with the piece to the end will learn something about the intentions and operations of the medical\/pharmaceutical industrial complex, and that’s a good thing. Stories that describe new allergy treatments are likely to have mass audiences, including parents who are hopeful they can ease their child’s severe food allergies. But will any of these treatments pan out, and one day be widely available and\/or affordable to the masses? It’s too early to say, and the story may raise some false hopes for not reining in some of the excitement with more about the realities of drug development.","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":9212,"claim":"New study finds EPA and DHA omega-3s lower risk of coronary heart disease","explanation":"This news release summarizes a recent paper published in Mayo Clinic Proceedings that evaluated the effect two types of omega-3 fatty acids — eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) — had on reducing risk of coronary heart disease. The report was a meta-analysis, meaning researchers evaluated the findings of multiple published studies. Specifically, the meta-analysis looked at 18 randomized controlled trials (RCTs) and 16 prospective cohort studies. RCTs are designed to measure the effect of a specific intervention under clearly-defined, experimental conditions. This means that researchers aim to determine, with some degree of certainty, whether a specific intervention is causing a specific outcome. Prospective cohort studies follow large groups of people over extended periods of time, allowing researchers to determine what characteristics or behaviors may be associated with specific outcomes. Because of the nature of these cohort studies, they can only tell researchers if a behavior or practice is correlated with an outcome — but not whether the behavior is causing the outcome. These sorts of meta-analyses can be extremely valuable tools for assessing a broad body of work on a given subject. However, this news release is problematic. It is written in a way that is confusing, if not misleading, and fails to make clear that the scientific-sounding organization that funded the study (and wrote the release) is an industry group that was created to promote the global use of omega-3 supplements or foods that are high in omega-3s. According to the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, approximately 370,000 people die of coronary heart disease each year in the United States. Many adults make decisions about their diet, activities and lifestyle based on how those decisions may affect their heart health. Research on subjects such as how omega-3 fatty acids affect heart disease risk play an important role here. According to a 2015 Washington Post article, people in the U.S. spend $1.2 billion each year on fish oil supplements, largely because they contain omega-3s that consumers think will reduce their risk of heart disease. But increasingly consistent evidence shows that fish oil does not, in fact, protect against heart disease. If people are going to make informed decisions about their personal health — and how they spend their money — they need to have good information that they can actually understand. News releases like this one make it hard for most consumers to understand exactly what the research says.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10213,"claim":"New DNA Tests Aimed at Reducing Colon Cancer","explanation":"Strengths:  Immediately, in the opening words, the story acknowledges that there is another DNA test in development that was reported on this week. It was the only one of the four stories we reviewed on this topic that made this clear. Weaknesses: It didn’t provide a meaningful comparison of the new approaches with existing colon cancer screening tests. It also has problems with how the underlying question is presented. Two examples:  “The new tests could help most people avoid colonoscopies, which are routinely prescribed for people over age 50.” – perhaps implying to the reader that evidence supports a recommendation of colonoscopy for everyone.That is not the case; there are several potential screening tests available, including other stool tests – something not mentioned in the story. “Compliance with colonoscopy is low, since people don’t want to have one, and the overall cost per detection is high because most people are healthy, and even colonoscopy misses many tumors in the upper part of the intestine.” This sentence has a lot of information, but is also somewhat misleading. Use of colonoscopy is actually pretty good, and most people who don’t have one have never been asked, calling into question that people “don’t want to have one.” The cost effectiveness of colonoscopy vs. other screening techniques is a complex question, but suffice it to say that the new technology being studied is not likely to be more cost-effective overall (previous stool DNA tests have performed much worse (higher costs, lower efficacy) than colonoscopy in modeling studies. This topic is really about when we should pay attention to evidence about a new diagnostic test and how we should evaluate diagnostic tests in comparison with one another- a topic that is often inadequately discussed in both medicine and journalism.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":8963,"claim":"Testosterone replacement therapy may slow the progression of COPD","explanation":"This release summarizes an observational study noting a relationship with two groups of men (middle aged and older), their consumption of testosterone replacement therapy and whether they are hospitalized for respiratory problems. It found that testosterone replacement therapy users had a decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users. While observational studies such as these are useful and hypothesis generating, they do not have the strength of a randomized, blinded trial and hence one cannot conclude that such associations are causal. Better information about the harms, costs and conflicts of interests of the researchers would have made this a better news release. If testosterone replacement therapy (TRT) slows the progression of COPD in men by producing a positive lung function, this could indeed be a public health advance. Observational studies, however, are problematic in that the two cohorts of men observed (those who take TRT and those who don’t) may be different in other fundamental ways. There could, for example, be a “healthy user bias” in that the TRT cohort of men may be naturally healthier at the start, and that any improvements in COPD function may just be a function of their basic overall health. Studies like these allow us to draw conclusions, but only that there is an association — not that TRT caused a reduction in COPD.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10019,"claim":"MRI Might Screen for Autism","explanation":"The story presents almost no information from the research study. We just know it was about MRIs in males with autism and that the researchers found something abnormal. We don’t know what the abnormal findings were, except they were related to how the hemispheres communicate. We don’t know whether the findings fit with a theory about the biology of autism or whether this was simply a fishing expedition. We don’t know how many of the 80 patients had the abnormality, if the MRI required special equipment or software, and if these were findings that any radiologist could detect. That’s simply too many gaps to make the story reliable. Study authors’ comments came from a news release. To its credit, the story did include cautious comments from one observer at the end. The challenge for this story is they are reporting on a basic science study, just one that happens to use MRI rather than bench techniques and one that was published in a specialized, technical journal. Autism is one of the most polarizing subjects in health, and the press can bear a big part of the blame. Reporting on autism tends to rely heavily on celebrity spokespeople, anecdotal profiles and advocacy organizations. It also has relied too much on science that has been improved upon or even discredited. That’s why it is even more important for reporters covering new research in autism to bring a very critical eye to the topic and to make good use of independent experts who can separate the emotions that understandably run high around the disorder from the science behind the research.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":11550,"claim":"Reverse your diabetes -- and you can stay diabetes-free long-term","explanation":"This release from Newcastle University describes a very small study that sought to control type 2 diabetes in patients through a reduced-calorie diet and a weight-management program. The results showed that 12 of the 30 participants saw a resumption of normal insulin production that continued for six months, supporting the release’s claim of “reversing” the disease. But what about the other 18 patients? A study this small can hardly suggest its finding are applicable to all type 2 diabetes patients which, in effect, it does. And benefits observed after only 6 months may not be maintained over the longer term. The release also omitted discussion of harms and alternatives, and didn’t give us a good picture of how the study was conducted. Rates of Type 2 diabetes have increased markedly in parallel with rates of obesity, especially in developed countries. It has long been recognized that diet, weight loss and exercise can improve the control of diabetes. Large studies investigating the impact of weight loss surgery have demonstrated that blood sugar results can return to normal after significant weight loss. It has also been shown that individuals who regain weight after surgery can then have blood sugars go up again and need to resume medications for diabetes. Patients and their families may excitedly assume that the approach described in this release is right for them and alter their normal regimen in the treatment of their disease. But adhering to the diet discussed in this release will be very difficult for most people and is not without risks. And despite the release’s suggestion of universal benefit, a “reversal” of diabetes did not occur in the majority of patients. Patients should understand that context when weighing whether to embark on such a diet.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":9256,"claim":"FDA Clears P-Cure Upright Imaging Solution  for Proton Therapy Enhancement","explanation":"P-Cure Ltd. device We’re fully prepared to believe that there are ways to more accurately administer proton beam therapy with fewer side effects and lower costs. This release makes just those claims and yet provides nothing to back the claims up. There is no quantification of benefits. No true exploration of risks. No explanation of the quality of the evidence. And no true comparison of alternatives. The release muddies the water on what kind of nod it got from the US’s regulatory agency. The company received FDA “clearance” to market the device but not an “approval.” (See the discussion under the Quality of Evidence criteria.) Proton beam therapy represents an alternative form of radiotherapy compared to conventional x-rays. Interest in this form of therapy has grown based upon its ability to deliver higher doses of radiation to a smaller field. This may improve the benefit and reduce the harm for patients with cancer who need radiotherapy. Although not a focus in this release, the proven outcomes of proton vs. conventional radiotherapy in terms of benefits (increased survival) and harms (less damage to surrounding normal tissue) are less clear than the proponents of proton therapy would like to admit. For many cancers, conventional therapy may be adequate. Here the question is whether the delivery of proton beam therapy to patients who are getting it can be enhanced by delivering the treatment to the patient in a seated compared to a flat position. One can imagine for some patients that may lead to a more comfortable treatment, but it isn’t clear how many would derive a measurable benefit. The release focuses on decreases in the discomfort of treatment and implies that some who may not otherwise tolerate this therapy could now have it. All interesting, but no information is provided to support the release’s claims. Finally, the release focuses on the potential benefits to the proton beam center in terms of its costs — but patients will have other questions about cost such as whether the device is more expensive than what the center is currently using. If so, those costs may be passed on to insurers and thus patients based upon the specifics of their policy. As such, it isn’t clear whether the “clinical breakthrough” or “paradigm shift” will be apparent to the average patient undergoing this form of cancer treatment.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":8984,"claim":"Older patients with knee pain may benefit from allograft transplant technique","explanation":"The news release focuses on a small-scale study comparing the outcomes of osteochondral allograft transplantation — a technique that replaces damaged knee cartilage with healthy cartilage from a donor. The researchers used the technique to treat knee pain in two groups of patients: those over the age of forty and those under the age of forty. Specifically, the release reports that osteochondral allograft transplantation — sometimes in conjunction with additional surgery — can be an effective treatment for older adults. However, the release offers little detailed information. For example, it fails to address costs, potential harms, or quantified benefits related to the procedure. It also didn’t explain that the control group used in the study wasn’t really adequate to demonstrate the effectiveness of the procedure. Knee pain is a common complaint that increases with age. In older individuals, symptoms are often related to arthritis due to “wear and tear” over time. Problems with the cartilage that covers the bone are thought to be a common factor that contributes to these arthritic changes. If the cartilage is lost in certain places, the result is bone on bone irritation without the protective surface that the cartilage provides. There are many causes for developing cartilage defects, but one is prior knee surgery, commonly arthroscopic (“scope”) procedures done to repair tears in the pad (meniscus) that cushion the knee bones. That is why most patients in this study had a history of prior surgery. Treatment for cartilage damage has focused on ways to regrow it so that the defects can be repaired. This study reports on one such procedure. The key issue evaluated here is the age of the patient. This is important because with increasing age the cartilage problems get worse and don’t respond to repair attempts. So studies demonstrating similar benefit in older compared to younger patients may be important. But it is also important to know that even in younger patients, such techniques haven’t been shown in high quality studies to really work, especially in longer-term follow-up studies. Thus saying that outcomes were similar in younger and older patients may mislead readers by overlooking the generally limited evidence of success, especially over time, in younger patients.","label":"false"}

To suggest that a drug which millions of people depend on is deadly and should be avoided at all costs, as the viral Facebook post suggested, is wholly irresponsible.

The researchers found no increased risk of asthma, depression, lung cancer or mental illness, which the story seems to accept as a big reassurance. We felt the story did not squarely address the study limitations as described by the authors themselves in the paper. Instead, the “surprising news” came in a single-source story, lifting quotes from a news release, without any independent perspective or adequate context. Millions of individuals, of all ages, are making current decisions about medical and recreational marijuana use every day. Medical research on the health impacts of that exposure matter for each person and for society as a whole. This story over-valued the conclusion of a single small study based on a sample of only young men. Yes, the study results were interesting and indeed add to a body of knowledge about the use of marijuana by adolescents but it is by no means definitive. Suggesting, “it’s all good” is a misleading leap based on this one limited study.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":11238,"claim":"ADHD Stimulants Might Help a Smoker With the Disorder Cut Back on Cigarettes","explanation":"This US News & World Report story discusses the possibility that some drugs used mainly to control attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) may be useful in helping people quit smoking. The story focuses on a very small pilot study where researchers claim an ADHD drug, lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, reduced the number of cigarettes a person smoked, although it had no effect on stopping their smoking habit. The story doesn’t mention either the cost of the drug nor any harms that might come from its use. It also doesn’t  provide enough information about the study itself for readers to adequately evaluate its results. Nor does it disclose that the study was funded by a pharmaceutical company and that some members of the research team receive support from pharmaceutical firms. Smoking is a serious addiction that causes serious health consequences in those with and without ADHD, so efforts to promote abstinence and decreased use are appropriate. But when it comes to the ADHD drug Vyvanse helping smokers quit, this article is much ado about nothing.","label":"MISLEADING"}

People were paid $7,000 to be in the study and all the food consumed in the study was provided to the participants to ensure adequate nutrition. The story didn’t explore the long-term practical implications of that approach for the average American.

This is an important caveat before concluding that the evidence demonstrates that such limits in caloric intake are beneficial.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":11529,"claim":"New Merck osteoporosis drug boosts bone density","explanation":"This story, about results from a Phase II trial of Merck’s new osteoporosis drug odanacatib, should not have been published in a mainstream publication. Phase II results are not necessarily predictive of Phase III results or of FDA approval. Readers looking for new treatments for osteoporosis are likely to assume incorrectly that safety, efficacy and availability are assured. The reporter could have tempered the story by interviewing independent experts with no stake in the drug being studied, who likely would have pointed this out. Further, by talking to an independent clinician, the reporter could have learned about existing treatments for osteoporosis and how this one could–possibly, and at some point in the future–compare. Supplements, diet and exercise have been shown to slow or even halt osteoporosis for some patients. So have some drugs currently on the market. The story also fails to clarify a point that would be valuable to consumers: That risk of fracture, not bone mass density, is the most meaningful outcome for osteoporosis drugs. Because this trial did not look at that outcome, the drug’s practical clinical value remains untested. The report should have plainly stated this caveat. And finally, it is well known that osteoporosis is a \"big market opportunity\" in the pharma trade. In other words, new drugs in this field, if well-publicized and well-marketed, can be huge revenue and profit drivers for the company. By failing to mention price, and the very strong financial motivation for a company to be first-to-market with a novel drug in this category, the reporter misses an opportunity to help educate readers about a source of rising healthcare costs–and to invite a skeptical view of news about unpublished Phase II results about this drug. Which is why we think this story should not have been published in a newspaper.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":35539,"claim":"By spring 2020, the sun had entered a \"lockdown\" period where its solar activity decreased to the point that famine, earthquakes, and freezing weather threatened life on Earth.","explanation":"What's true: Solar activity, which is often defined by the amount of sunspots on the star's surface, pendulates on a roughly 11-year cycle. The most recent cycle, which began in late 2008, peaked with sunspots in April 2014 and then steadily decreased until reaching a \"solar minimum\" — or a period with zero sunspots — in late 2019 and 2020. That means, yes, by spring 2020, solar activity had reached a so-called \"lockdown,\" or solar minimum. What's false: While the sun had entered a so-called \"lockdown\" period — when the number of sunspots on the star's surface decreased to few or none, technically called a \"solar minimum\" — by spring 2020, it was a normal occurrence for the star and was not projected by scientists to threaten life on Earth with famine, earthquakes, or freezing weather.","label":"false"}

Canova also said Wasserman Schultz voted to subsidize the sugar industry when she voted for the farm bill in 2008 and 2014. The farm bills didn’t contain actual cash subsidies, but they clearly contained lucrative benefits for the industry.

{"claim_id":11526,"claim":"Breast Cancer Drug Breakthrough","explanation":"This story reports on a potentially important development in the prevention of breast cancer among high risk, postmenopausal women. The story is clear that this is an existing drug for osteoporosis that has not been approved by the FDA for use in breast cancer prevention. The story also does not make claims about when it may be approved for that purpose. There is no obvious disease mongering; the story accurately represents the prevalence and seriousness of breast cancer  Although there is mention of a clinical trial, the story does not describe the study design. Also not mentioned was the fact that the results have not yet been published or peer reviewed, so interpretation of the clinical significance of these results are difficult at this time. Benefits of treatment are quantified in relative terms only. The viewer is told that raloxifene and tamoxifen both reduce the incidence of breast cancer by about 50%, however there is no context provided for these numbers. Most viewers would want to know “50% of what?” They want the absolute risk reduction. Viewers should have been told that even though the women in the study were high risk, the incidence of breast cancer over 5 years was still very low. The story also does not mention that raloxifene does not reduce the incidence of ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS, which tamoxifen does), so it is not clear that when the story says the benefits are equivalent between the two drugs, if it will hold true if they include all breast cancer events (including DCIS, which is found quite commonly these days). The story also omits an important fact: the decrease in incidence of uterine cancer and clots in the raloxifene group was not statistically different from the tamoxifen group. Although uterine cancer and blood clots are mentioned as harms of treatment, there is no mention of how often they occur. Other harms such as cataracts and stroke are not mentioned. No costs are mentioned. According to the website for the STAR trial, the cost of Raloxifene is about $75 per month, while Tamoxifen costs about $100 per month. Because these drugs have to be taken for long periods of time, cost is an important issue.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":8952,"claim":"Getting relief from sexual dysfunction and incontinence caused by menopause","explanation":"This news release summarizes an observational study on the benefits of CO2 ablative laser treatments for reducing menopausal symptoms like vaginal dryness\/itching\/burning, painful intercourse, frequent urinating, or incontinence in 94 post-menopausal women. While the release makes the claim that the study “demonstrated that this type of laser surgery was particularly effective in reducing the intensity of dyspareunia (painful sex) and dryness,” it was an observational study which cannot show cause-and-effect. The release notes that this intervention is a subject of debate among experts, and that more studies are needed to confirm the long term efficacy and safety of this approach. It falls short in several areas: it neglects to mention that the FDA warns against using lasers for menopause symptoms, excludes any data from the study, and omits disclosure of significant financial conflicts of interest among study authors and the organization that distributed the release, the North American Menopause Society. It’s estimated that around half of post-menopausal women have at least one of the aforementioned constellation of symptoms that some doctors label “genitourinary symptoms of menopause,” or GSM, and others see as normal (but problematic) symptoms of a low estrogen state. Some women respond well to symptomatic treatment, others may choose hormone replacement, and some struggle to find relief. It’s important to point out that many women seek no treatment at all. For women interested in treatment, finding reliable information can be problematic. Thorough and thoughtful news releases and news coverage should, at the very least, provide:  good data balancing the benefits and potential harms, give a sense of safety and efficacy in comparison to other existing treatments, seek out independent experts not involved in the highlighted study, as well as fully disclose if that study could be biased by conflicts of interest.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":11446,"claim":"Abaloparatide may help prevent fractures in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis","explanation":"This release from The Endocrine Society describes the results of one of a series of randomized, double-blind comparative clinical trials of abaloparatide-SC, an investigational drug designed to increase bone mineral density and prevent bone fractures in postmenopausal women who have osteoporosis and who already had suffered one fracture. The study was presented as a poster presentation at the Society’s recent conference. The release helpfully — and carefully — notes early that the research is “industry sponsored.” The release did a good job discussing the study design and results but didn’t address potential cost and harms. Some health organizations estimate more than 200 million women (and men) worldwide have osteoporosis and that in the United States, 43 million adults are at risk for osteoporosis and that the disease is responsible for about 2 million broken bones each year. Various prescription treatments are on the market designed to increase bone mineral density and either prevent fractures in the first place or reduce the risk of a subsequent one. Exercise, diet and lifestyle also are involved in risk factor prevention and modification, and all of the prescription drugs carry risks for some women of serious side effects, including higher than usual risks for a rare form of bone cancer, kidney stones, weakness, respiratory infections, and dizziness. The costs of some treatments also are high. Thus, any news of additional drug treatments will be of significant interest to millions of women and men.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":9225,"claim":"Saturated fat could be good for you","explanation":"A single, brief study from Norway claims to demonstrate that saturated fats are generally beneficial for most people, in contrast to much research that suggests potential heart risks are associated with higher saturated fat intake. The study of 38 men with abdominal obesity took place over a 12-week period and compared the effects of either a high carbohydrate or a high fat diet. This study, though randomized, only measured markers of risk such as blood pressure and triglycerides (not actual heart disease) for a short period of time. Current recommendations regarding fat intake are based on actual rates of heart disease found in large groups of people followed for years. It’s not unreasonable to raise questions about the role of saturated fat in heart disease. Researchers readily acknowledge that existing studies on the issue have important limitations. However, this release goes too far in describing the significance of this single small study, and gives no acknowledgment to evidence that cuts the other way. The release also lacks information expected of a solid account of a new nutrition study — such as a measurable benefit, harms, and details of the diet’s contents. Substantial claims require substantial evidence. This release claims to present data that upends the conventional wisdom on dietary fat, but it doesn’t acknowledge that the study has important limitations. Nor does it acknowledge the many other studies that have addressed the same questions examined by this research. People are already confused enough about what they should be eating. The last thing they need are sweeping claims, like “Saturated fat could be good for you,” that aren’t backed up by definitive evidence.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10509,"claim":"Drug trial success a boost for Arena","explanation":"This was a story about a possible new medication in the pipeline that may enable people to lose weight. It did not include the information needed to understand the relative strength of the study reported about and did not quantify in absolute terms (number of pounds lost)  the benefit that might be attained with the use of this medication. It was an interesting piece in that it made an attempt to contrast this medication with one that was withdrawn from the market. However, in light of this comparison, the story should have explained something about the time frame of the current study, and how that compared with the period of time that was needed for the problems with the drug that was withdrawn from the market to be observed. It should have also mentioned that the current trials with the new medication specifically exclude people with type of heart issue that was seen to be problematic with the withdrawn drug. The bottom line is that while the company may be optimistic that this drug will not result in harms, there are not yet sufficient data available to determine whether this is the case. It would have been useful to readers had the story made this clear. Finally, this was a San Diego paper reporting on “mid-stage” trial results on a San Diego company’s product. It is doubtful that the paper would report on such results from another company in another location. Applying that “business news” approach to health care product news is often problematic. It gives local readers a skewed picture of the research landscape and may give undue weight to the local idea.","label":"false"}

This story does a nice job of explaining the way the virus works and offers readers reactions from a variety of scientists. Clearly a lot of legwork went into this story. But we were disappointed to see that none of these sources provided any critical evaluation of the research or pointed to any caveats — of which there are quite a few. In addition, while the piece’s patient stories don’t overdo the “good news” aspect of the treatment, we wished for more data and a more thorough discussion of the ultimate outcomes that matter to patients such as survival time. Newer and experimental treatments for malignant melanoma have changed the uniformly poor outcome for this cancer. But the legitimate excitement surrounding these treatments must be tempered with acknowledgment that the benefits are limited and not everyone benefits. The treatments are very costly and can still cause significant harm to patients.","label":"MISLEADING"}

The news release explains the specificity and sensitivity of the test. It also clearly discloses who funded the research. One downside is that it’s not until the final paragraph that we learn this is still experimental research that must be confirmed in larger studies. Earlier statements make it sound farther along, e.g., “researchers at The Rockefeller University have developed an automated technology that combines imaging with digital analysis and machine learning to help physicians detect melanoma at its early stages.” A larger concern is how the release downplayed the high-false positive rate of 64%, saying this “approaches” the false-positive rate of manual detection by expert dermatologist, which studies put at about 32%. Melanoma can be very difficult to diagnose so if doctors could use a tool that helped better screen suspicious-looking moles, they might be able to improve the accuracy of diagnosis and save lives. This new approach thus far has shown promise, but further research will be needed to validate it as an enhanced diagnostic tool–and that should be made upfront and clear to the journalists and consumers who read the news release.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":11506,"claim":"Lipogen Targets PMS\/PMDD Relief, Naturally","explanation":"This news release announces an Israel-based company’s success in obtaining a U.S. patent for a proprietary “phospholipid formulation” called PS Plus, which is purported to treat physical and “emotional” symptoms of premenstrual syndrome (PMS) and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD). Somewhat misleadingly, the release suggests the formulation was “designed” to address PMS and PMDD, when in fact it appears to be the same single-ingredient supplement already sold to provide “brain support,” “sharpen memory” and ameliorate “stress.” Prevalence statistics presented in the release are contradictory and qualitatively lightweight. There is evidence in the literature of some clinical testing of phosphatidic acid, a natural phospholipid, or fatty acid derivative of soy lecithin, used as a carrier for some experimental drugs, but it is the only active ingredient mentioned on the product website – and not at all in the release — and there is precious little information about other ingredients or costs anywhere. PMS is a very common health condition in women of reproductive age. As such, women in this age group and in many countries may be interested in “natural” remedies to alleviate some of the symptoms. Additionally, Americans are high users of complementary and alternative medicine (CAM) interventions. Recent studies have noted that in the United States, “approximately 38 percent of adults (about 4 in 10) and approximately 12 percent of children (about 1 in 9) are using some form of CAM.” Moreover, CAM use among adults is greater among women and those with higher levels of education and higher incomes – exactly the population this news release is trying to reach. The supplement industry’s so-called “orthomolecular” therapies, which claim to maintain health with the use of natural compounds, have long been the subject of public health and scientific controversy, and come-and-go fads among consumers who spends millions on supplements for which rigorous evidence of clinical value is at best scant. For an aging population of boomers, in particular, the promise of protecting and boosting brain health (and by inference reducing the risk of age-related dementia), has been especially appealing, particularly if the products claim to be “natural” and with no ill effects. Similarly, for younger women, claims of safe, natural relief for  PMS and related syndromes are appealing, given that the conditions have long been “medicalized,” and such treatments as hormone replacement therapy and anti-depressants — all carrying risks and adverse effects —  have been over-prescribed and costly. Consequently, there is likely to be substantial interest in a product that promises to relieve what the release says are “more than 200 different symptoms” of PMS, and protect and enhance brain function.","label":"false"}

There’s some evidence that health care costs generally go down when drugs are made available over-the-counter, but those studies did not look specifically look at the pill. There is a lot of uncertainty and experts — from advocates to economists — question whether Gardner’s proposal would be cheaper to most consumers or the health care system compared to the Affordable Care Act.

{"claim_id":9285,"claim":"Study Suggests Breastfeeding May Lower Risk of Childhood Leukemia","explanation":"Do formula-fed children face increased risk of leukemia? This news release summarizes a published report on data from 18 separate studies worldwide that, when analyzed together, suggest breastfeeding is associated with reduced risk of developing childhood or adolescent leukemia. But that’s basically the only message conveyed by the news release, which is otherwise devoid of important context, including — most importantly — on the limitations of the observational design used by all of studies in the analysis. The release’s incomplete, one-sided presentation will most likely lead to a flurry of overblown media coverage that could have negative repercussions for the many women who cannot or choose not to breastfeed. There are many reasons for women to think that breastfeeding is a good choice for their babies. Is leukemia prevention one of them? That’s the suggestion of the study reported on here, which is a re-analysis of previous studies examining the question. It’s worthwhile research, but let’s remember that these underlying studies all relied on a backward-looking case-control design that is subject to selection bias and a variety of other potential problems. And the scope of the potential benefit for this condition, which is thankfully quite rare, is limited. Our worry here is that women face a number of physical and lifestyle constraints that may affect their ability to breastfeed. And women who can’t breastfeed already experience guilt that they aren’t doing enough for their babies. Should they also be made to feel as if they are putting their children at increased risk of cancer? That’s not a justifiable message based on this study. But without more careful communication of study limitations and other context, we’re afraid that that’s the message that could ultimately reach the public.","label":"false"}

The study involved 10 individuals with a history of SIPE and 20 control subjects. The news release, based on the study published in the journal Circulation, describes the condition and the study parameters nicely but then overwhelms the cautionary comments appropriate for such a modest design with an enthusiastic testimonial from a participant who felt the medicine was a life-changer. The release would be stronger if it had added some quantification of the benefits and relied less on a patient testimonial to make its case.

{"claim_id":10402,"claim":"Medtronic insulin pump beats injections in study","explanation":"It touts benefits of insulin pumps and blood glucose sensors without mentioning potential harms. It fails to tell readers that the trial included only a subset of patients and thus the results may not necessarily apply to people with diabetes in general. It implies that the improvement seen in the intermediate endpoint measured (A1C blood sugar levels) will actually reduce the risk of eye, kidney, heart and other diseases without making clear that this trial was not designed to reveal differences in actual health outcomes. It makes no mention of the financial ties between the researchers and insulin pump manufacturers, even though the researchers’ published conflict of interest disclosure summary was substantially longer than the news story itself. This thumbnail sketch of medical device trial results that may suit the needs of investors trying to predict stock performance fails to meet the needs of people who need relevant information about ways to manage diabetes. But does it really even give investors the true nitty-gritty they need?","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9674,"claim":"Ibuprofen patch heralds side effect free drug future","explanation":"To begin with, the headline of this story is a little much: a “side-effect free future” with this patch? Surely, we can’t dispense entirely with oral ibuprofen even if this patch were to deliver everything it promises. And while it makes sense that transdermal delivery would reduce stomach-related side effects, do we really know if this approach will eliminate other possible side effects that aren’t related to the GI tract — for example related to cardiovascular risk? The advantages of the TEPI patch (this apparent acronym is never spelled out in the story) over existing products on the market sound impressive and believable — although very little evidence is given to help us assess the quality of these claims. The promise of transdermal drug delivery has been on the horizon for decades and the TEPI patch is the latest iteration. Ibuprofen and the other NSAID’s are safe and effective for the vast majority of people taking them. People with chronic conditions like osteoarthritis are at risk for side effects because of the relatively large doses taken orally. In theory, a patch could reduce the likelihood of these side effects but the proof is simply not there yet.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":11150,"claim":"Genetic tests detect new way to fight war on breast cancer","explanation":"The story discusses new genetic tests that may help some women with early-stage breast cancer determine their risk of recurrence, and thus help with decisions about chemotherapy. More tailored (often less) chemotherapy is a newer idea for women who may not benefit as much from more aggressive treatment. A favorable score on a genetic test does not mean a woman at lower risk will not benefit at all from chemotherapy; she may, in fact, benefit some over the long term, but not as much as a woman with a higher chance of cancer recurring. Also, a woman's values and ability to live with a certain amount of risk, though small, is still part of the decision to have chemotherapy or forgo this treatment. The story presented no quantitative evidence for the Oncotype Dx test, which was the main focus of the story. It only said the test had been independently validated via a peer-reviewed process, and that it had been used on over 17,000 women. This test is validated only for women with node-negative breast cancer whose tumors are estrogen receptor-positive. The story does not mention that the test is time-sensitive and must be used within six months of diagnosis. The story emphasizes the cost of Oncotype Dx and notes that this may make it prohibitive for some women whose health insurance does not cover the test. The story is balanced and does not appear to be taken from a press release. A breast cancer specialist, a public health researcher, breast cancer patients and the CEO of Genomic Health, makers of Oncotype Dx, provide perspective on genetic testing as an aid in decision-making for breast cancer treatment .","label":"true"}

While there appears to be a quid pro quo — the United States would not give Iran the cash until the prisoners were on their way home — this does not equate to ransom, experts told us. Iran had a legitimate claim to the money, as the United States owed it to Iran as part of a resolution to a decades-long financial dispute. It’s unclear whether the prisoner and financial disputes were connected in just the final hours of the prisoner transfer or if there was more advance coordination.

{"claim_id":10851,"claim":"New test can detect autism in children, scientists say","explanation":"A small European study found increased biomarkers in the blood of 38 children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) when compared to 31 healthy children in the control group. This story jumps the gun by implying the results suggest these biomarkers cannot only “detect autism in children” but also “could lead to earlier diagnosis.” This speculative language appears to come directly from the lead author of the study who’s also quoted as saying “we hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors.” What would have helped this story considerably would be interviewing sources not affiliated with the study to clarify the limitations of these biomarkers, explain how ASD is currently diagnosed, and provide some much-needed context about the novelty, availability, and clinical relevance of the biomarkers studied. Autism spectrum disorder includes a wide range of problems with social communication and interaction, as well as behavioral issues that can be repetitive, compulsive, and\/or disruptive in many social settings. The condition cannot be predicted or cured, so any news coverage about a potential screening method needs to be extremely cautious and pay special attention to the limitations of the study at hand, as well as include critique from independent sources.

{"claim_id":9100,"claim":"New recommendations for managing menopausal symptoms in breast cancer survivors","explanation":"This news release lists several non-pharmalogical steps for relieving menopausal symptoms of women who have been treated for breast cancer. The main takeaway is that most women who have been treated for breast cancer shouldn’t receive hormone therapy, but instead focus on lifestyle changes although some emerging pharmacologic approaches were listed as well. It’s not clear from either the news release or the published study how researchers drew their conclusions. The release states that clinical trials, observational studies, guidelines, and expert opinion were analyzed, but no study data is provided to put the findings in perspective. Women who are dealing with premature menopause as a result of breast cancer treatment would benefit from a better understanding of risks and benefits of treatments. The news release states that there are 9.3 million breast cancer survivors worldwide but doesn’t note, as the study does, that 43 percent of these are older than 65 at diagnosis and thus would not have menopausal symptoms due to chemotherapy for their breast cancer. The study also notes that 25 percent of those diagnosed are below age 50 and are thus more likely to be pre-menopausal at diagnosis.

{"claim_id":11330,"claim":"Fish oil linked to lower Alzheimer’s risk","explanation":"This story reported on the findings from a recent research study that found lower rates of dementia in individuals who had higher levels of docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in their blood. They were also able to show individuals who consumed 2 or more servings of fish per week were found to have higher levels of DHA. The reporting about this study is a good example of where the relative risk reduction sounds impressive but the absolute risk reduction is small. Yet the story provided only the relative risk numbers, not the absolute. (Read more about absolute vs. relative risk.) Although it's good that the story pointed out the harms that are associated with fish oil consumption and the lack of FDA approval of fish oil as a means to prevent dementia, it neglected to mention that there currently are no evidence-based means to reduce the incidence of dementia. The story also ought to have included information about other reasons the authors might have found the results they did (chance, confouding dietary or behavioral patterns, etc). Because it is possible that these and not the fish consumption per se are associated with reduced dementia, it is information that a reader should be aware of. The headline of the story – \"Fish Oil Linked to Lower Alzheimer's Risk\" – is somewhat misleading because the results of the story demonstrated that fish oil was associated with lower risk of all-cause dementia; when an attempt was made to parse out the effect of fish oil on Alzheimer's disease specifically, its effect was not statistically significant. It should be noted that this story was not the only one to fail to appreciate this distinction. The editorial accompanying this research in the Archives of Neurology was entitled \"Docosahexaenoic Acid and Alzheimer Disease\" and nowhere in the editorial was the distinction made between Alzheimer's and all-cause dementia.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9043,"claim":"Postoperative wound monitoring app can reduce readmissions and improve patient care","explanation":"This news release reports on a feasibility study of using a smartphone app to detect post-surgical infections that patients might not recognize on their own. The news release does an exemplary job of discussing the need for such supports as patient training and dedicated staff to monitor uploaded images and points out that the study lacks a cost analysis. However, the headline overreaches when it states that the app “can reduce readmissions and improve patient care,” since this two-week study of 40 patients wasn’t geared to do that. Post-surgical infections can cause pain, poor wound healing, and severe problems including death, research has showed. The release noted they’re the most expensive hospital-acquired infection, costing an average of nearly $30,000 per wound-related readmission and an estimated $3-$10 billion annually. While smartphone apps might improve the ability of staff to monitor surgical wounds, news releases should point out the need to invest in a support structure — such as staff to train patients and monitor data — and should refrain from stating benefits that haven’t been demonstrated.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10862,"claim":"New Therapy Delivers Long-Term Relief for Chronic Back, Leg Pain, Study Finds","explanation":"The release reports on a study that tested a new type of implanted device for the treatment of chronic back and leg pain. It uses high-frequency electrical pulses, delivered directly to the spinal cord via implanted leads. The study compared this high-frequency form of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) to a more traditional approach that uses lower-frequency pulses. The main advantage of the new approach, according to the release, is that patients don’t feel an annoying tingling or buzzing sensation that’s associated with the traditional approach. The release faithfully reports the outlines of the study in broad strokes and provides some of the outcomes in user-friendly terms. But there a lot of missing context that any reporter relying on the release should have been given. Notably, this was a company funded study run by investigators with close ties to the manufacturer of the device. The surgery required to implant the device can cause harms that weren’t mentioned. Finally, it’s not clear if this device is approved for use and if so, how much would it cost to have it implanted and would insurance cover that cost? Many people have chronic pain that isn’t satisfactorily addressed with existing approaches. If a new device can improve on those existing therapies as is claimed in this release, many people would be interested to know about it. But along with offering the good news about potential benefits, release writers have an obligation to provide context that cuts the other way — whether that’s possible harms from the device, conflicts of interest among the researchers, or limitations to the study design. They also owe it to readers to present a full array of potential alternatives. This release sets up what seems to be a false choice between SCS and either surgery or narcotics. Patient can also try yoga, exercise, NSAIDS, and behavioral modifications — treatments that can work and have little cost and risk.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":17569,"claim":"Rhode Island’s teen binge drinking rate is double the national average.","explanation":"Regardless of your opinion on the larger point, the Physicians Committee for Responsible Medicine sought to make it with an incorrect comparison. It claimed \"Rhode Island’s teen binge drinking rate is double the national average,\" deriving that claim by comparing numbers from two different surveys. But the most recent report that includes both national and state-by-state figures show that Rhode Island’s rate was actually less than the national average. We rule the claim False.

{"claim_id":10557,"claim":"Blood test for Alzheimer’s","explanation":"This report fairly describes a promising but not imminent blood test that may be able to identify people with Alzheimer’s disease. It does a good job, particularly in a broadcast piece, of describing how the study was conducted and its potential implications. The story could have been significantly stronger, however. The report should have indicated how small the groups were, so people could appreciate the potential fragility of these findings. The report failed to disclose vital information about conflicts of interest that was easily available. The person-on-the-street interviews contribute nothing of value, but they consume valuable seconds which could have been devoted to the two areas mentioned above–or to providing insight from a clinician. The ABC News website has a much more complete report on the study. The broadcast segment should have referred viewers to it.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":11603,"claim":"FDA approves Epclusa for treatment of chronic Hepatitis C virus infection","explanation":"This release announces the approval by the FDA of a new pill, Epclusa, for patients with chronic infections with Hepatitis C virus, also known as HCV. The tablet combines an existing drug, sofosbuvir, with a new drug, velpatasvir, and is the first single therapy for all six major forms of the virus. Patients can be infected with different forms and require different treatments. The release informs on the novelty, harms and benefits of the drug but doesn’t give reporters — or lay readers — much background on the clinical trials that led to the approval. An estimated 120 million people have HCV infections worldwide, with an upper estimate of 3.9 million in the US alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). This new treatment — Epclusa — has an estimated cost of about $74,800 per 12-week necessary therapy length — or about $900 per pill. But without treatment, many HCV patients may require years of treatment and suffer damage to their livers that require transplants and could ultimately be more expensive. The economics of new drugs is a vital part of any story about the drugs. We wish this release had included some context on the cost issues surrounding HCV infection for both patients and the society at large. A blogger with Bloomberg News focused a post about the drug pricing which has been controversial due to the millions of patients affected.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":17890,"claim":"One out of four corporations doesn't pay a nickel in (federal income) taxes.","explanation":"Sanders said that one out of four corporations doesn’t pay a nickel in taxes. The statement reflects a 2008 study from the Government Accountability Office. However, the GAO study did not distinguish between firms that had losses in the normal course of business and those that reported losses solely through the use of the tax code. Groups along the political spectrum give much weight to the costs of doing business that can lead to a bad year. There is wide agreement that losses in one year can be carried forward and that salaries are an unavoidable expense, to mention just two factors. Special tax breaks and abuses of the tax code exist but even an analysis from a group that shares many of Sanders’ perspectives pointed to a ratio that was, at most, one out of six and possibly as small as one out of 16. The one out of four statistic fails to take into account many relevant factors.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9222,"claim":"Immunotherapy shows promise in preventing leukemia relapse","explanation":"This release about a small trial of immunotherapy applied to a dozen leukemia patients who are at unusually high risk of relapse leaps to premature interpretations and inflates the meaning of the results far beyond the limited guidance for future research that this sort of study can offer. It inappropriately elevates the importance of relapse rates, implying that they predict vital outcomes, such as survival or quality life improvements, which this trial did not measure. Even as it puffs up the potential benefits, the release neglects to note either the short-term harms reported by researchers in their scientific conference abstract or the potential life-threatening harms that immunotherapy may expose patients to. The release doesn’t provide context for how these trial results relate to  existing or other experimental treatments, and it makes makes only an oblique reference to the personal financial stakes of a lead researcher. It does not make any reference to cost, even though recently-approved immunotherapy treatments suggest the price tag could be in the hundreds of thousands of dollars. On the positive side, the release does a good job of explaining why adjuvant treatment to enhance the immune system after bone marrow transplant may be necessary in certain leukemia patients. Relapse rates may reveal important clues to how long patients may live or how they will feel, but then again they may not. Any surmised connection between this sort of intermediate endpoint and the things that really mean something to patients must be tested. Until survival or quality of life trials are performed, news releases should not imply that an intermediate endpoint result, such as relapse rate, predicts better or longer life for patients.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9410,"claim":"Early Prostate Cancer Kept at Bay in Two Studies for High-Risk Men","explanation":"This story summarizes the results of two studies involving drugs for the treatment of prostate cancer. The main takeaway from the story is that in certain men with high-risk cancers who’ve already had their prostates removed, the drugs extended the amount of time before these men’s cancer spread beyond the prostate. The story helpfully quantifies the amount of time the drugs bought these men in absolute terms. But the story missed some important context. For example, the story is totally silent on the issue of adverse effects and how many patients suffered them. And it doesn’t caution that the outcome reported in the study — “metastasis-free survival” — may not translate to a corresponding increase in patients’ overall length of life. Disease-mongering was also a concern. The story features statistics about the huge numbers of prostate cancers diagnosed each year, but it doesn’t acknowledge that most of these cancers will never progress to cause problems for the patient. Moreover, it erroneously suggests that prostate removal is the “typical” approach to the treatment of early prostate cancer, when no treatment at all is the approach favored by about half of all men who receive such a diagnosis. An independent source would probably have helped bring some balance to the coverage, but the only experts quoted had a vested interest in the research. Despite having their prostates removed, men with aggressive forms of prostate cancer face a higher risk of having that cancer spread beyond the prostate. There is currently little that such men can do following initial treatment except watch and wait, but these preliminary results suggest that certain drugs may delay the spread of these cancers. Until the results are published and scrutinized by other researchers, however, it’s best to reserve judgment and view the claims of vested interests skeptically.","label":"MISLEADING"}
