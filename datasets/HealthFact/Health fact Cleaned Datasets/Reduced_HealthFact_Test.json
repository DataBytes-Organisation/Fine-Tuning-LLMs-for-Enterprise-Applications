{"claim_id":10748,"claim":"Humira Provides Effective, Non-Steroid Alternative for Eye Inflammation","explanation":"A study of 217 people afflicted with an eye disease called uveitis tried to determine just how well adalimumab, a pricy “biologic” drug, could stave off frustrating symptoms like inflammation inside the eye, floaters, cloudy vision, and blurred vision. Every patient received standard daily injections of a corticostroid called prednisone, but half were also given a placebo injection, and half were given injections of adalimumab, which is FDA-approved to treat other diseases. Adalimumab held uveitis at bay for 24 weeks, or nearly twice as long as the control group at 13 weeks. But that extra uveitis symptom control came with two costs: a significant uptick in “severe adverse events” and a treatment that costs 50 times more than the one it supplemented. The study published in the NEJM was one of two that supported FDA approval of the drug for uveitis. As this news release clearly points out, the study was sponsored by the company that sells the drug and many of the authors served as paid consultants to the company. The Duke Medicine-issued release about the study also grasped the benefits and quality of the evidence very well. Uveitis, or inflammation of and damage to important structures in the eye, is a relatively rare disease that affects about 43,000 new people a year in the United States, according to the Ocular Immunology and Uveitis Foundation. While treatable, left untreated it was once a leading cause of blindness worldwide. Most people are treated with daily injections of a corticosteroid called prednisone. However, steroids like prednisone, used long-term or sometimes only briefly, can lead to diabetes, osteoporosis, and even psychological changes, since they not only only dial back inflammation, but also affect the body’s metabolism. So any drug that can more specifically target the inflammation seen in the eyes of uveitis patients could cut back these risks and improve treatment efficacy. Adalimumab (marketed as Humira) is approved for several other immune system diseases including psoriasis, arthritis and Crohn’s disease. Although adalimumabit is not a cure for those diseases or for uveitis, it is an alternative to steroids. That said, the drug comes with side effects, many of which have to do with its action in suppressing the immune system which increases the risk of infections and cancer.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":9355,"claim":"Maintaining healthy vision may help keep brain in shape, too","explanation":"Scientists have established a relationship between clearness of vision and cognitive function in older individuals; they seem to rise or fall together. But does one cause the other? In an attempt to answer that question, a trio of researchers introduced time into the analysis, exploring the relationship between clarity of vision at time 1 and cognitive function at time 2, and vice versa, repeatedly over an 8-year period. The study does find a relationship but, given the large number of participants in the study (more than 2500), it is a modest one. Alas, that does not deter either sources in the story or the headline writer, who opt into causal statements that are far stronger than the data warrant. Maintaining cognitive capacity is a major goal for aging individuals, so anything that contributes to that objective is worth attention. If eye health indeed proves to be a substantial contributor, that will ramp up attention to diagnostic and treatment options. But such behavior awaits more robust studies, and stories about this link need to tread cautiously.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10093,"claim":"Concussions in kids are detectable by blood test","explanation":"This news release describes a recently published journal article on a study that evaluated a blood test that was designed to detect concussions or traumatic brain injury in children. The study reports that head injury causes the release of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) from the brain into the bloodstream, and that the levels of GFAP in the blood correspond to the severity of the head injury. According to the release, the blood test correctly identified the presence of concussion or traumatic brain injury in 94 percent of the cases. But the release fails to mention that many positive results from the test would be false-positives, which would result in additional testing and may pose additional health risks. The release notes that concussion and traumatic brain injury are usually diagnosed based on symptoms — such as perceived balance problems or reports of headaches or grogginess — and that the blood test provides an objective test that can be used for diagnosis. However, the release fails to speak to a more important aspect of the marker, that is it’s potential negative predictive value. As noted in the study the biomarker has a 98% negative predictive value. That means that a negative result, if the biomarker holds up to additional testing, would rule out concussion. According to the CDC, approximately 248,000 children were treated for concussions or traumatic brain injuries in U.S. emergency departments in 2009. And that number doesn’t include children who were taken to a family physician or who went misdiagnosed or undiagnosed. Concussions can have significant impacts on a child’s health and well-being, with symptoms ranging from headaches and dizziness to memory problems and behavioral changes. What’s more, the Mayo Clinic notes that having one concussion increases the risk of a child’s having a second concussion — and repeated concussions can have a multiplier effect. The development of an objective test that can accurately diagnose concussions in children without the use of CT scans, would certainly be a significant advance. However, it’s important to recognize the limitations of the current study and to address issues such as potential misdiagnosis.","label":"false"}

But this depends on how proactively the authorities enforce gun laws. Experts say widespread gun confiscation is implausible.

{"claim_id":9921,"claim":"Omega-3 Fatty Acids May Lower Breast Cancer Risk in Postmenopausal Obese Women","explanation":"This release describes the results of a study testing whether omega-3 fatty acids have a beneficial effect on reducing the risk of breast cancer in obese women by reducing the density of their breast tissue. Higher breast tissue density is recognized as a marker for increased breast cancer risk. The study involved a small group of women who received the omega-3 fatty acid, the omega-3 in tandem with a chemo-preventative drug Raloxifene, the drug alone, or no treatment at all. According to the release, at the end of two years, women considered obese (their body mass index — BMI — was greater than 29) showed a reduction in breast tissue density, which the researchers argued reduced their cancer risk. However, this is misleading. This finding is from a small subgroup of obese women within the already-small study. The main finding of the study — which is never even mentioned in the news release — is that the supplement had no impact on reducing high breast density whether taken alone or in tandem with Raloxifene. The release also omitted projected costs and harms of the prescription-only supplement used in the study. The American Cancer Society predicts that 246,660 new cases of invasive breast cancer will be diagnosed in women this year and that more than 40,000 women will die from this disease. Easy actions that women can take to prevent this disease, or at least reduce their risk of getting it, are of almost universal interest to the public. If it is shown that taking a readily available supplement like omega-3 fatty acids will reduce breast cancer risk in obese women, that’s information that will be of wide interest.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9164,"claim":"Dry needling offers alternative to cortisone injection for hip pain","explanation":"This news release from an orthopedics journal relates a study finding that dry needling, which uses filament needles to stimulate trigger points in the muscles, is just as effective as cortisone injections when it comes to reducing pain and swelling caused by greater trochanteric pain syndrome (GTPS), a common hip condition. We applaud its restrained tone but would have liked to get a sense of how much symptom improvement patients experienced during the six-week trial as well as a discussion of costs and availability of these two treatment options. This release says the effectiveness of steroid injections “is increasingly being questioned. An equally effective treatment with fewer adverse side effects would be beneficial.” To conclude that dry needling is “not inferior” to a treatment that isn’t very effective doesn’t say much. There is no slam-dunk treatment for chronic hip pain. But if it comes with low risk and a modest cost, dry needling might be an alternative to steroids for combating chronic pain. Also, dry needling might offer an option for patients who haven’t felt relief from steroids or are precluded from taking them due to medication interactions. As the release states, GTPS is very common and at times very painful. A safe, successful treatment that rapidly resolves pain (beyond normal natural healing) would benefit many individuals. A specific risk profile of a single cortisone injection in the soft tissues has not been determined but most researchers and practicing physicians would consider it to be minimal.","label":"MISLEADING"}

This story gives readers key facts and a range of expert reactions and context about a study that re-analyzed heart disease prevention experiments and saw lower rates of cancer deaths among trial participants who had been assigned to take daily low-dose aspirin. Readers are clearly told that while this study provides new insight, there are some key questions that need to be answered before many experts would change their recommendations about aspirin. The only important shortcoming is that it reports only the relative risk reductions without also telling readers about the absolute differences in cancer death rates that the researchers observed. Cancers of all types are second only to heart disease as the cause of death in developed countries. A number of observational studies have suggested that the kind of low-dose aspirin regimen recommended for some people at risk of heart disease may also have some cancer-related benefits. This study attempts to avoid some of the inherent limitations of observational studies by using data that was collected as part of experimental trials that randomized people to take aspirin or a placebo pill.

It’s difficult sometimes for journalists to dig and find conflicts of interest in those making claims about health care interventions.

And neither story discussed the costs of biolgic drugs in the treatment of psoriasis. These drugs can cost $1,500-2,000\/month. We think that any discussion about a new drug should include some comment about costs. Psoriasis is a chronic skin condition that, in its more aggressive forms, can produce a good deal of discomfort and disfigurement. Treatments to date have improved but a mainstay drug, methotrexate, is limited in its effectiveness and can have some nasty side effects. Biologic drugs such as Stelara, Humira and Enbrel are somewhat more effective but very expensive.

{"claim_id":9177,"claim":"New blood test may predict cardiovascular events in patients with or without coronary artery disease, research shows","explanation":"The news release reports on research suggesting that testing for plasma ceramides, a type of blood lipid, might enable doctors to identify individuals at higher risk for heart attacks and strokes even though they have healthy cholesterol levels and no evidence of coronary blockage. It provides a readable and reasonably straightforward account of what the researchers did and why it might be important, but there are a number of significant omissions. First, the release should have acknowledged that this test — even if it does effectively identify individuals at increased risk of a heart attack or stroke — may not lead to treatment that actually lowers that risk. Knowing about an increased risk doesn’t mean that risk can be reduced. Many other similar risk markers have been proposed over the years and so far haven’t been found very useful for actually guiding treatment that improves outcomes. Moreover, the research discussed in the release was being presented at a scientific meeting, meaning it has not yet gone through the peer-review process for publication in a journal. In addition, the news release provides no information about the costs of the new test, which appears to be available only through Mayo Medical Laboratories. It also does not discuss the possibility of false positive results, potentially leading to unnecessary treatment. Cardiovascular disease, including heart attacks and strokes, kills more Americans than any other disease, including cancer. Although health experts have long advised people to try to maintain low cholesterol levels – especially for low-density lipoprotein (LDL) – research suggests that as many as half of all heart attacks occur in individuals who have normal cholesterol levels. In addition, heart attacks can occur in individuals, especially women, for whom angiograms show no blockage of the coronary arteries.","label":"MISLEADING"}

The story didn’t tell readers this was an observational study–cause-and-effect couldn’t be established. Also, there is no discussion of the risks of this kind of screening test, notably the risk of false positives and false negatives. The study does not, as the headline states, allow doctors to “spot dementia 10 years earlier.” This is an important distinction. Identifying important risk factors for dementia can be valuable, in part because it gives patients opportunities to make lifestyle changes that may reduce that risk. On the other hand, telling readers that a test can spot dementia “10 years earlier” makes it sound as if the outcome is a foregone conclusion.","label":"false"}

Where we found broad consensus is that decades of aggressively putting out every fire as quickly as possible, and the use of land for grazing, created circumstances where the forests are brimming with fuel. That in conjunction with extended dry periods have turned them into tinderboxes. The federal strategy to remove that fuel runs up against budget constraints. The limited money is a much greater constraint than environmental policies. In the end, experts acknowledge that environmental policies are an issue, but they generally tip the scale toward other factors when assigning blame.

{"claim_id":9138,"claim":"Starving prostate cancer with what you eat for dinner","explanation":"This news release attempts to translate preliminary research on plant chemicals into actionable dietary advice. Bad move. Researchers used an innovative screening strategy to cull through 142 natural compounds to identify a combination of three phytochemicals — found in foods such as turmeric, apple peels and red grapes — that inhibited the growth of implanted prostate tumors in mice. Their work is described in the online journal Precision Oncology. But it’s a big leap from the lab table to the dinner table, where the release says that by indulging in certain foods, you can “enjoy the fact that you are eating something that could play a role starving — or even preventing — cancer.” Nowhere does it warn that studies of cell lines or animals don’t prove a human benefit. Combinations of plant chemicals have become a focus of cancer research, driven by their relative safety, low cost, and wide availability. Lab studies have found substances in plants can reduce inflammation, stimulate the immune system, protect and repair normal cells, and slow the growth of cancer cells, among other things. But research on the effects of these substances to fight specific cancers is still in its infancy, and most experts advise eating a wide variety of fruits and vegetables for better health. Prostate cancer is an area where men feel particularly vulnerable because it’s widespread — about 3 million American men are living with prostate cancer, according to the National Cancer Institute — and there are few actionable steps for prevention. Suggesting a simple solution — such as eating a few specific foods — may give men a false sense of security.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10592,"claim":"New hormone therapy sparks debate","explanation":"The story presents bioidentical hormones as a new option for relieving bothersome symptoms of menopause such as hot flashes, cold sweats and vaginal discomfort. The story accurately reports that the active ingredients of these supposedly “natural” hormones are the same ones used in synthetic hormone replacement therapy (HRT). However, these hormones are not as well-regulated or well-tested as synthetic versions. The story provides no evidence that bioidentical hormones are more effective or safer than traditional HRT. Positive testimonials from a physician employee of a bioidentical hormone supplier, a celebrity and women who have experienced reduced menopausal symptoms with  bioidentical hormones are not a substitute for quantitative evidence. The comment that a hormone product can be tailored to a woman's chemistry is not proven. Additionally, the story does not mention the cost of bioidenticals, which are typically about $50\/month, similar to the cost of conventional HRT. Any physician can provide a prescription for bioidentical hormones in a routine office visit. The story appropriately stresses that menopause is a natural part of aging and not a disease which necessitates medical intervention. The story also mentions that short-term use of HRT in any form should be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Unless symptoms are very bothersome, many women do not need to take HRT to ease symptoms common in menopause. While the bioindentical hormones are marketed as a natural alternative to balancing hormones and easing bothersome symptoms of hormonal fluctuations during menopause, the story fails to mention the least risky “natural” interventions for managing symptoms of menopause, such as exercise and wearing loose, cool clothing to prevent discomfort from hot flashes and cold sweats. The story also does not mention non-hormonal, evidence-based pharmaceutical options for managing symptoms. However, using these medications for treatment of hot flashes would be considered an off-label prescription. (See a previous review of a story on this topic.)","label":"MISLEADING"}

This story does a good job of presenting evidence about this harmful and potentially fatal practice. It successfully addresses the disease-mongering that could result around this emotionally charged issue. The story was well done but could have included a few more details such as the cost of various chelation treatment.

{"claim_id":10201,"claim":"Partial rather than full knee replacements better for many – report","explanation":"This story parrots a news release sent out by Oxford University about a study published in the journal BMJ Open. The study concludes that partial knee replacements would — in many cases — leave patients “better off” than total knee replacements. With no independent reporting, the story glosses over how the study was conducted, what was measured, and what the limitations were. It also didn’t discuss harms of surgery, among other problems. An over-reliance on publicity materials appears to be a pattern — last week the Guardian received a 1-star score from us for a different story that also simply restated what the news release said. Knee replacement surgeries are not uncommon. A 2015 study reported that, as of 2010, there were 4.7 million people in the U.S. who had received a total knee replacement. If partial knee replacement (also called a unicompartmental knee replacement, or UKR) is an option for many patients, and the partial version could improve outcomes and reduce medical costs, then this is a finding with the potential to significantly improve life for patients (and make U.S. insurers happier in the process). However, it’s important to highlight the risks associated with such a decision — even if those risks could potentially be reduced by seeing an increase in partial replacement surgeries over time. The importance of this research is that for some people a less-invasive surgical procedure may be an option, but the choice isn’t quite so clearcut as the researchers imply.","label":"false"}

The finding described in the news release only applied to mice being fed a high fat diet (45 percent from fat), whereas when on normal chow and intermittent fasting on normal chow, there wasn’t much difference. The release was short on numbers and descriptions of measurements used, and implied that the mouse studies could benefit people, without any caveats that such a transfer of mouse discovery to practical application in humans often fails. The release did name the funders and avoided sensationalizing obesity. Obesity is an enormous public health problem. But this release misleads the reader into thinking its conclusions will transfer from the mice in the study to human patients with obesity. We were disappointed by this quote from one of the researchers: “Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,” says Kyoung-Han Kim.” Based on the published study, we don’t find any evidence that this has been proven for human patients.

{"claim_id":10229,"claim":"Lung Cancer Breath ‘Signature’ Presents Promise for Earlier Diagnosis","explanation":"Image courtesy University of LouisvilleThis release discusses a study testing the efficacy of a test using the breath of lung cancer patients. Since patients with lung cancer are known to have specific chemicals in their breath — known as volatile organic compounds (VOCs) — which are caused by the disease, detecting them after the patients underwent surgery could indicate a recurrence of the disease. These chemicals are, in effect, markers for the presence of disease. The release notes the study showed a reduction in the amount of these compounds after patients had undergone surgical resection of the lung, but doesn’t give any numerical information about the level of reduction, other than to say it is “significant.” The release provides a nice description of costs and describes the test’s potential benefit to reduce harm from repeat CTs. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States with 224,000 new diagnoses each year and 158,000 deaths, according to the American Cancer Society. Both early detection and successful monitoring of disease recurrence might reduce those numbers considerably. Current monitoring for lung cancer recurrence after surgery is based on X-ray computed tomography (CT) scans. A breath test using chemical markers to detect recurrence could potentially be cheaper, simpler and less risky than repeat CT scans. However, it’s important to keep in mind that a positive breath test would still necessitate a follow-up CT scan and with almost every screening test, there is a risk of missed diagnosis.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":11395,"claim":"Shire Announces Positive Results of SHP465 Safety and Efficacy Study in Children and Adolescents with ADHD","explanation":"This news release announces the results of a randomized, controlled Phase 3 clinical trial of a long-acting stimulant drug for the treatment of attention-deficit\/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in children and adolescents. The pharmaceutical company Shire completed this follow-up trial on the drug’s safety and efficacy after the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required more data when Shire first sought approval for the drug. The drug was tested in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years old with ADHD. The company claims that the drug showed significant improvement in both children and adolescents when compared with a placebo and on the clinical global impression improvement scale, a standardized measurement of improvement. While the release is clearly targeted to investors and financial reporters, it was distributed and made available to a wide public audience. Just because a release is written for a business audience does not mean it should skimp on transparency. Its biggest weakness is the strong claims it makes without providing any links or references to published research where the results can be evaluated. We perused the company’s website for details of the study but came up empty-handed. The news release doesn’t mention the lead investigator’s financial relationship with the drug sponsor, projected costs of the new drug, nor make any comparisons with numerous similar drugs already on the market. This news release matters to the company since it is aiming to launch a new formulation (currently referred to as SHP465) of a drug similar to Adderall, also developed by Shire, which faces generic competitors. The new formulation essentially comes with a new patent for an old drug — the main difference being a longer half-life (or longer daytime effect) — 16 hours versus 12 hours for the current Adderall extended release pill. As the news release states, this new launch would extend Shire’s patent on its “ADHD Franchise” for many years: “Protection for Shire‘s ADHD Franchise Extends to 2029 “There are patents supporting Shire’s overall ADHD franchise in the U.S. that extend to 2029. With a launch planned for the second half of  2017, Shire expects that SHP465, following potential FDA approval, will have three years of Hatch-Waxman exclusivity and at least three patents listed in the FDA Orange Book expiring as late as May 2029.” The news of a new drug formulation might be important for children and adolescents with ADHD who are frequently given amphetamines to treat their symptoms. But it is unclear how this drug differs from existing amphetamines already in use.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":11470,"claim":"“Spiral” CT scans reduce smoker deaths: study","explanation":"We wished that some of the strong elements included in this story could have found their way into some of the other coverage of a study about the effects of spiral CT scans on reducing lung cancer deaths. Conversely, we wish this story had included more of the information necessary to give readers a complete picture of the benefits of this type of screening for cancer. Smoking rates and the incidence of lung cancer have been falling in the US for several years. Despite these gratifying trends, about 225,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer in 2010 and approximately 157,000 will die from the disease. A major factor in survival after diagnosis is early detection. Chest X-rays are not sensitive enough to pick up lung cancer in its early stages. That is why more sophisticated diagnostic testing has been sought. Spiral computerized tomography (CT) has been touted as the best way to diagnose lung cancer early and save ives. This landmark study has demonstrated that spiral CT’s are indeed more senstive than chest X-rays and that early detection can save lives. The study is by no means a complete answer, and it raises many questions. Who should be screened, when, how often and who is going to pay the enormous bill are some of the obvious questions. Stories like this need to give the evidence an independent and critical analysis to help readers understand whether more screening is necessarily better for identifying lung cancer and saving lives.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9298,"claim":"Metformin may lower lung cancer risk in diabetic nonsmokers","explanation":"This release reports on an NIH-funded study to determine if the use of the drug metformin by diabetic patients may affect their risk of developing lung cancer. The overall answer is that it does not, but the release takes five paragraphs to say that. Instead, it focuses on a very small subset of patients who had never smoked and whose lung cancer risk appeared to be lower than never-smokers who didn’t take metformin. By trumpeting findings from that subgroup — and burying the main results of the study, which were negative — this release misrepresents the research findings and misleads its readers. We’d suggest that the findings of this study probably did not warrant the spotlight provided by a news release. But if a news release is to be issued, it should lead with the results for the primary outcome and give second billing to provocative but preliminary findings from subgroups. While not as egregious as another example of subgroup “spin” that we recently reported on, this news release will certainly give readers the impression that there’s something special about metformin when it comes to preventing cancer in people with diabetes, when that hasn’t been established with any certainty. Diabetes is a chronic disease requiring long-term use of drugs such as metformin. Some research suggests that metformin may decrease the risk of lung cancer — making the results of this study an important addition to the scientific literature. Unfortunately, the release focuses almost entirely on the results seen in a small subgroup of patients. As such, it doesn’t accurately reflect the totality of the research in question. Subgroup findings can be included, but should never supersede the main outcome.","label":"MISLEADING"}

In the huge wave of medical science stories that flood the American public every day, editorial decision-makers need to evaluate what the impact is of overwhelming readers with an endless stream of stories about findings, about progress in research, about un-analyzed medical minutiae.

{"claim_id":11399,"claim":"Blood Test May Predict Rheumatoid Arthritis","explanation":"There has been recognition that RA results in gradual, cumulative destruction of joints and other parts of the body. Since we now have powerful treatment options, there has been a push to begin using them earlier. However, it’s harder to identify RA in its early stages, when diagnostic techniques such as RF testing aren’t as helpful. Therefore, there is a need for new diagnostic techniques for the identification of patients with joint problems in the early stages of RA. That’s the context, and the social problem, described in the article. The study in question, however, is a little different. It’s about understanding the processes that lead to RA and techniques that may, in the future, lead to a test for patients who may develop RA in the future. There is no available evidence that treatment can stave off RA in patients who don’t have symptoms yet. We would have liked to have seen the article use additional sources besides the press release. Where it does not rely on the press release, it seems to stray too far. The article claims that the investigators \"say the finding paves the way for developing a blood test for early diagnosis of the mysterious disease.\" We don’t believe they said that, neither in the published study nor even the press release. The authors say the technique could help identify people at risk for developing RA in the future — people who are not yet patients — as opposed to patients who have an early stage of the disease. Contrary to the article’s headline, the study in question did not assess a blood test for RA, and there is no blood test now. After the headline, the story really never improved.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":9838,"claim":"Gene test could spare women from unnecessary radiation","explanation":"Women diagnosed with small breast tumors known as ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) often have to make treatment decisions (including whether to add radiation therapy after surgery) without being certain about how much risk of a recurrence they really face. This story reports the results of a study that compared the genetic profile of tumors to the long-term cancer recurrence rate in a group of women. The story provides multiple views and useful context. However, most readers would likely assume that treatment decisions that incorporate these test results would offer better health outcomes. This story should have clearly stated that this study was not designed to answer that important question and that follow-up trials will be need to document the health effects of using this test. Predicting risk is one thing. Knowing which treatment is most likely to produce the best outcome for a patient with a certain risk level is a different question. People often confuse the two; so news reports about risk assessment should take special care to point out that improving the ability to predict a patient’s future does not necessarily mean that you can change that future. Eric Winer’s cautious comment was an important part of the story – “he’d like to see additional studies before using the test to advise patients.”","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":11288,"claim":"Study: Fatty acids can help ease PMS symptoms","explanation":"The story didn’t even report which symptoms improved, or even a list of what was being measured. There are so many symptoms associated with PMS — ranging from physical to behavioral — that it’s important to know which symptoms they are talking about. Studies of PMS are notorious for showing a strong placebo effect, but we can’t tell whether taking the supplement adds much benefit. There was also no discussion of cost and no independent expert perspective. Consumers spend millions of dollars on supplements, and these supplements are not well regulated. Any story about benefits runs the risk of sending people to their wallets, and they should be particularly cautious. Pre-menstrual syndrome, which is the butt of many jokes, is a severe problem for a small minority of women and can cause cyclic symptoms: bloating, fatigue, mood swings and headache. While only a minority has severe symptoms, many women have some of these. Journalists have an additional responsibility to provide context and caution when they report on claims of benefit from an unregulated substance for a huge population.","label":"MISLEADING"}

The research highlighted is the next chapter in what has been a multi-year effort on the part of the investigators to develop a new approach to the treatment of Type 2 diabetes. The researchers’ previous work in animals and now in a small cohort of people with Type 2 diabetes is not well represented in the release. There’s no clear discussion of how the device works.

{"claim_id":9859,"claim":"Problems spur FDA caution on insulin pump","explanation":"First, let’s be clear that this is a review of an Associated Press story as shortened by the St. Paul Pioneer Press. Some of the flaws commented on were not present in the original AP story. The story was about a 10-year retrospective study of adverse events resulting from adolescent use of insulin pumps conducted by the FDA and published in the May issue of the journal Pediatrics. Insulin pumps are being used more often to deliver insulin to the body through a plastic tube with a small tip that inserts under the skin. The article provides a good description of the pumps, indicating that they are approximately the size of a cell phone and can be worn on a belt or kept in a pocket. Insulin pumps have been primarily used by adults but are now being used more often by adolescents because it allows them to lead more normal lives by eliminating the need for them to give themselves insulin injections in public. The results of adverse events reported by in the FDA study, including 13 deaths and more than 1,500 pump-related injuries over the past decade, were accurately presented. However, no denominator was given so the numbers lose context and meaning. Estimated causes of these adverse events – patient misuse, lack of education, and device malfunction – were also described. A notable omission from the story was the importance of parental supervision as three of the 13 deaths occurred when there was no adult supervision. The original AP story provided a good overall summary of the health concerns related to insulin pump use among adolescents and the need for for more study to address safety concerns. But all for the sake of cutting 290 words, the St. Paul Pioneer Press version lost:    any discussion of cost – something lacking in about 75% of all stories we review. (And at a time when the US devotes 16% of the GDP to health care spending!) the emphasis on the parental oversight issue the perspectives of two other knowledgeable sources  Yet it left in a defensive comment from the Medtronic company \"which makes the top-selling insulin pump.\" Why cut out independent perspectives and leave in the Medtronic comment? Is it because it’s a local Twin Cities company? Not a good reason in our estimation.","label":"true"}

That’s 10 million more than her estimate of lives lost in all of last century’s strife, 153 million. But this is using a high estimate for the first measure and a low estimate for the second. The number of sex-related deaths, which varies from year to year, typically falls within 100 million to 130 million range. The number of deaths due to war, according to most other estimates, is about 200 million. Both numbers are disturbingly high, but it’s not clear that one is definitively higher than the other.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10822,"claim":"Mammograms Save Lives for Women in Their 40s, Study Says","explanation":"The story focuses on results of a Swedish large study that showed a survival benefit from annual breast cancer screening for women in their 40s. This story also briefly reviews a recent study reported at the same conference, however, dealing with survival from breast cancer. Simply put, these are two separate issues (screening and survival) and it is very confusing to put the results and comments together in the same piece. Perhaps largely because the story doesn’t adequately evaluate the quality of the evidence of the new Swedish study, it has an unbalanced feel of promoting annual mammograms based on this recenty published data and via the selection of experts cited. The downsides of screening for women 40-49 are not discussed at all. While this story begins telling readers that \"Another study…finds that screening can lower the risk of dying…\" –  look at how other competing stories began:   4th paragraph of AP story: \"The new study has major limitations and cannot account for possibly big differences in the groups of women it compares.\" 1st paragraph of LA Times blog story:  \"Critics charged that the study was poorly designed and potentially vastly misleading.\" 2nd sentence of NY Times story:  \"Results were greeted with skepticism by some experts who say they may have overestimated the benefit.\" No such skepticism, no such independent critical evaluation took place in the HealthDay story. Women – especially in their 40s – must be terribly confused by the swirling studies. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations last November, the American Cancer Society and others’ backlash against it, the Norwegian study in the New England Journal of Medicine, and now the new Swedish study. This is when journalism must rise to the challenge with an extraordinary effort to help evaluate evidence, ask tough questions, and offer insightful analysis. That just didn’t happen with this story.

{"claim_id":11057,"claim":"Oregano, Thyme May Hold the Cure for Wasting Syndrome Disease","explanation":"This release suffers from over-reach and obfuscation — a bad combination. The release cites some pre-clinical animal research at the University of Iowa that suggests that components of the spices oregano and thyme may represent a “cure” for cachexia, a wasting disease that affects cancer patients and others with debilitating diseases. Unfortunately, readers aren’t told that the research was in mice — not humans — until very late in the release. There’s no information on whether the research has been published, or met any other form of peer review. (When we asked to see the study, the media relations team at the university declined and told us the research hadn’t been published.) The spice compounds referred to aren’t named, nor are cost or potential harms addressed. The release doesn’t explain who funded the research or disclose that the university has applied for a patent on the compound. It doesn’t note that the researcher quoted in the release is listed as the inventor on the patent application and would likely stand to benefit financially from its commercialization. The release does note that a pharmaceutical firm has been licensed to market a drug based on the research. Editor’s note: This news release raised serious questions about oversight of the University of Iowa’s research-related communications to the public. We blogged about those questions here but have yet to receive a satisfactory response from the university media relations team. Update 8\/24\/17: A response received from the university, more than two weeks after the initial request, raises additional serious questions about the university’s process for promoting research, which critics termed “utterly irresponsible.” We wrote about it here. Cachexia is a serious condition typified by chronic weight loss that can affect a patient’s nutritional status and ability to undergo or continue treatment. Striking those with chronic diseases, it weakens patients and in some cases can hasten their demise. If it could be thwarted by compounds from spices, that would represent a real boon. But this release — and the research it reports — does not provide readers with valid and adequate information. Unfortunately, it may play on the hopes of those afflicted with cachexia and their families, offering false hopes instead of new findings.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9692,"claim":"Cortisol levels in children's hair may reveal future mental health risk","explanation":"This story reports that in an Australian study of 70 children (average age 9.5 years), those who had experienced a higher number of traumatic events also had higher levels of the stress hormone cortisol in samples of their hair. The researchers are hypothesizing that the cortisol levels might be a marker of future mental health problems in the children, as people with depression and other mental health problems, as well as physical problems like diabetes, sometimes have high levels of cortisol. Here’s the problem with this story: The study being reported on never actually looked at whether cortisol levels had anything to do with future mental health diagnoses. And in fact, cortisol levels were found not to be correlated with current depressive symptoms in these children. Moreover, the study had such a small sample as to make any conclusions resulting from it highly uncertain. So it’s a huge stretch to claim that cortisol in hair “may reveal future mental health risk” in children. We wish the story had been more cautious, especially in its headline, when discussing the implications of this very preliminary research. Childhood lays the foundation for one’s health over a lifetime, so identifying people who have risk factors for health problems early on — as with a simple hair test — is an attractive idea. This might allow for early intervention to modify risk and get people into treatment sooner, lessening the impact of disease or behavioral problems on their lives.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10484,"claim":"Doctor Challenges Cause Of MS And Treatment","explanation":"This story explores the controversy surrounding a new surgical procedure, similar to balloon angioplasty for blocked coronary arteries, that purportedly treats multiple sclerosis. The story’s emphasis on skeptical perspectives is appropriate for a treatment that hasn’t been rigorously studied and whose biological basis remains questionable. And in a story where it would have been all too easy to profile someone with a “miracle” recovery following the procedure, the writer defies convention and focuses on the disappointed patient who didn’t derive the expected benefit. For all its appropriate caution, the story lacks the exploration of evidence that we feel is the core of any good health story. It talks a lot about conflicting studies and quotes various expert opinions, but it never provides a run down of what kinds of studies have been performed and what they’ve found so far. This kind of information is critical for informed decision-making about treatments. Multiple sclerosis is a condition that rightly instills fear in patients who have been diagnosed with it. Despite this fear, for many the course of MS is slow and not associated with significant impairment. However, for some it is a relapsing and remitting condition that inexorably progresses to disability. Though there are FDA approved treatments for MS, the treatments have modest benefit and real side effects. Thus, any new treatment that offers a cure or can slow down or reverse the course would be of tremendous interest to those affected.

{"claim_id":10326,"claim":"Provenge vaccine prolongs life in prostate cancer patients","explanation":"This story provides many of the key details readers need to understand the results of the trial of Provenge – being evaluated as a treatment for advanced prostate cancer – but the overall tone of the story emphasizes the good news while soft-peddling the caveats. Even though the story points out that only a third of men receiving the experimental approach were alive three years after they entered the trial, it would be understandable if readers concluded that Provenge is a dramatic advance in prostate cancer treatment and offers substantial advantages, with no disadavantages, compared to the chemotherapy typically offered similar patients. This USA Today story was about half the length of the AP report we also reviewed. Important facts were omitted that undercut the usefulness of the story; for example, the failure to note that the lead researcher owns stock in the company developing the drug or that the FDA declined to approve this drug two years ago because of concerns about potential side effects and questions about its actual effectiveness. While some cancer experts quoted elsewhere termed the trial findings an \"incremental\" advance, all of the comments included in this story portrayed the results as a dramatic advance. The story did not explain that the results have not been peer-reviewed and that independent experts have yet to see the raw data.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":11093,"claim":"When Size Matters, Men Can Turn to Penile Extenders: Study","explanation":"The lack of cost information was a significant hole in the story, and there was no discussion of the limitations of the study or alternatives to treatment, especially given that the consensus in this story appears to be that most men with dissatisfaction about their penis size are suffering from a perception problem, not a physical problem. With some of these improvements, the story could have provided a much better service to readers. There’s a lesson in this story for journalists to do a better job checking conflicts of interests in sources. The story didn’t disclose that one of the authors has conducted research on a penile traction device and is quoted on the company’s advertising materials. Penile enhancement — along with hair replacement — is one of the most popular medical interventions targeted at men, and it is often the purview of medical providers outside the mainstream. Because men who perceive themselves as being sexually inadequate are particularly vulnerable to aggressive marketing about ostensible cures, it is especially important to evaluate the claims being made by plastic surgeons and the like. This story does a decent job doing just that. Several of our grades for different criteria were toss-ups, but we hope that our comments – far more important than the overall “star score” – will help guide journalists and consumers in evaluating the evidence.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10620,"claim":"Landmark clinical trial shows gene-targeted drug can treat prostate cancer","explanation":"This small phase ll study looked at responses to the drug olarparib, and its action on a particular type of prostate tumor mutation. While the news release indicates that this is pioneering work in the field of personalized prostate cancer treatment, there is still much to be skeptical about the practice of isolating cancer-related genes with new targeted drugs. The key point not made in the news release is that the study did not demonstrate any mortality or survival benefit in the act of identifying and targeting men with mutated prostate tumors and giving them olarparib. The news release comes across somewhat as a promotional vehicle for genetic testing and yet comparing it with the test for BRAC (breast cancer susceptibility gene) mutation would tend to give it a gloss it might not deserve. Without results with this form of  “precision medicine,” hyping genetic testing around this type of metastatic prostate cancer feels a little irresponsible. The final line: “Understanding the link between prostate cancer and DNA repair mutations is incredibly important for patients and their families” seems to be putting the cart way before the horse and is likely to confuse and build unreasonable expectations among prostate cancer sufferers. Many men still die from prostate cancer and if there were an easy genetic test that could pinpoint which prostate cancer sufferers were most likely to benefit from a targeted drug therapy this could be a huge advance. The news release presents hype and hope yet one has to refer to the published study to find any real information, where the researchers report: “We cannot yet determine whether olaparib improves overall survival among patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer and DNA-repair defects.”","label":"false"}

That means women could not have an abortion about two weeks earlier than before. The only stated exception was to save the woman's life. However, the previous law didn’t expressly include those exceptions either, though it had broad language that could potentially have been used to seek abortion for a rape or incest survivor in the third trimester. No woman, though, has had an abortion in Florida during the third trimester for any reason in recent years, even before the new law. The statement is accurate, but needs additional information.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":10888,"claim":"Study Shows Limited Benefits From Calcium","explanation":"This piece reports on the outcomes from the Women’s Health Initiative about the effectiveness of calcium and vitamin D to prevent hip fracture. Although the results showed that the level of calcium and vitamin D supplementation did not significantly reduce hip fracture, they did find that this level of supplementation did increase the risk of kidney stones. There were several interesting points raised in the study that were not reported on in this story. This first is that the methods used to encourage supplement use was only adequate to get a subset of the women studied to take the supplements. The results also point out the discrepancy between the common measure of ‘bone health’ (bone density) and the outcome of importance (fracture rate). Lastly, the study also showed that women who fell were significantly more likely to have a hip fracture than those who never fell. This raises the question of whether an intervention to reduce the likelyhood of falls would be useful for reducing risk of hip fracture. The overall tone of the article is suggestive that women beyond menopause should still take these supplements, though this is not consistent with the results of the study.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":11516,"claim":"In Small Test, Experimental Prostate Drug Shows Promise","explanation":"Notwithstanding the headline, this is a story about two drugs for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer – Provenge, a drug recently approved by the FDA for the treatment of advanced prostate cancer and XL184, a compound currently under study. Combining the information for these treatments is a bit confusing. The news about XL184 reflected results which at that point had not yet been presented at a cancer conference in Berlin. While indicating that it is too early to say whether XL184 actually affects the cancer, the story should have reminded readers of the importance of things like quality of life and survival time. And there isn’t evidence about those factors yet with XL184. At issue is that, while advanced prostate cancer is a challenge, not all men with advanced prostate cancer would benefit from Provenge, though the story neglected this. And it is not clear that XL184 is of benefit to anyone. News about results from a small study that is still ongoing cannot carry enough caveats. It is really too early to know whether XL184 really shows promise or not. It is bad enough when journalists write glowing stories based on reports from scientific meetings. This story goes one step beyond that and reports on the outcome of a small trial before the scientific meeting has even been held. Although there are numerous caveats embedded in the story, it still provides a rather optimistic view of a drug based on early testing in 20 men. For reasons that we don’t understand, the story only reports on 20 of the 99 men enrolled in the study and only reports on the more positive results (those related to bone scans). This selective reporting provides the readers with a very limited and imbalanced view of the study results.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10461,"claim":"Researchers produce first widely protective vaccine against chlamydia","explanation":"In many ways, this release provides much of the basic information reporters would need to determine how newsworthy the findings are.

But nowhere does it mention that this was a study conducted in mice and that, if past experiences with vaccines for other diseases hold true, a true vaccine for humans has a narrow chance of becoming a reality. Chlamydia is the most commonly reported sexually transmitted disease (STD) in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The CDC says the condition is easily treated, but if left untreated, can make it difficult for a woman to become pregnant A further complication of chlamydia is that it often carries no symptoms, so someone who is infected may not even know it. A safe and effective vaccine would certainly be of public health interest. But this research has to far to go before it will be available to the public — if ever.","label":"false"}
