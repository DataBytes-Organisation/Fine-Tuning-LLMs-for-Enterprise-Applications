0,Mindfulness Meditation May Cut IBS Symptoms,"Among several weaknesses in the story, the biggest was a failure to evaluate the quality of the evidence – a failure to help readers understand what this study might mean and what it might not mean. As we state below in our “Evidence” criterion: “We aren’t told if the symptom improvement is clinically meaningful. After all, IBS is a chronic condition and this is a short-term study. And most importantly, the reporting is confusing: “Changes in quality of life …..were not significantly different…. but all were much improved at the 3-month followup in the meditation group.”  And no explanation was given of how symptom changes were measured. Or what was meant by “all were much improved at the three-month followup.”  That’s a big weakness in the story.”  Many people are interested in non-medical approaches to improving health. Mindfulness meditation and other complemenary and alternative therapies, along with exercise and nutritional recommendations are of high interest. Mindfulness meditation and similar therapies are unlikely to have adverse effects and have the potential to be very low cost therapies.

5,Novel 'patient-friendly' colonoscopy prep shows excellent efficacy and safety,"This release summarizes an investigational study on a ‘novel’ colonoscopy bowel preparation under development by a Massachusetts-based company. The release claims that the prep is a more palatable regimen that includes solid food bars and low-volume beverages. Researchers report that by the end of the Stage 2 clinical trial, the regimen was as safe and effective as two currently available colonoscopy prep formulations in cleaning out the colon, and, importantly, participating trial volunteers gave the preparation a high rating. The release did a good job of describing the study and quantifying benefits. The existing preps that the novel formulation was compared against were never mentioned and that seems an important omission. The release also didn’t provide enough details about harms, or a ballpark cost estimate, which it seems reasonable to expect in almost all news releases. The study was presented at the American College of Gastroenterology’s 2016 annual meeting. The standard bowel preparation and prolonged fasting required to ensure a clean viewing field for the gastroentologist is daunting and has been suggested as a limiting factor in acceptance. For those approaching the magic age,  Dave Barry’s 2009 article in the Miami Herald provides a humorous look at this screening procedure. But the reality is that colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and individuals should have a discussion about the benefits and risks of the procedure. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. Should the prep described in the release hold up throughout the clinical trial process, it may be welcomed by individuals facing a colonoscopy.",Misleading,True,False,0.20304608345031738

12,Impact of first federally funded anti-smoking ad campaign remains strong after three years,"CDC Tips ad campaign features advice from former smokersThis news release focuses on a recent study that evaluates the effectiveness of a 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) educational advertising campaign called “Tips From Former Smokers” (Tips) that aimed to encourage and help cigarette smokers quit smoking. The release highlights the health risks associated with smoking and the estimated effectiveness of the ad campaign. The release also argues that the Tips campaign was a cost-effective means of helping people quit smoking. It provides some good background data on the health-related costs of smoking as well as estimates on how many people were reached through the ad campaign. However, the release does not give readers a hard number on the campaign’s cost. It would also have been good to know how the effectiveness of the Tips campaign compared to other “quit smoking” efforts. There are few activities as closely tied to adverse health outcomes as cigarette smoking. As the CDC notes (on its site, not in the release), “cigarette smoking harms nearly every organ of the body.” Smoking is linked to significantly increased risks of stroke, heart disease and lung cancer, with close to 500,000 deaths each year attributed to smoking in the United States. Smoking is not only a national health issue, but a global health issue. A 2015 study estimated that, globally, cigarette smoking causes approximately $500 billion in economic damage (largely through health costs) each year. For these reasons, finding effective means to help cigarette users stop smoking is clearly of widespread interest. However, that means taking a critical look at just how well anti-smoking campaigns actually work. And one way to do that is through the lens of a cost-benefit analysis, and comparing the outcomes of multiple campaigns. This release would have been stronger if it had helped readers make the necessary comparisons.",Misleading,True,False,0.19949841499328613
13,"Multigene test may find risk for heart disease, diabetes and breast cancer","This Associated Press story describes a new approach aimed at analyzing genetic data to assess the risk to patients of developing five specific diseases, and giving people a “polygenic score.” The new approach looks at multiple genes at the same time, and the role they play, in developing these diseases. Many current genetic tests focus on seeking individual genes that have been changed. The story needed more caution–there are plenty of unknowns here. For example, even if a person knows their score, there’s no proof that having that number will improve health outcomes. What, for example, should a person do if they find out they’re at high risk for heart disease, but don’t have any signs of it? Also, false-positive and false-negative results could be significant. Predicting a person’s risk for serious and life-threatening diseases is valuable, both to the individual and to public health. So any refined improvement in how we gauge that risk is a true benefit. But this story uses the findings from one effort looking at a British database and extrapolates too broadly without offering readers the kinds of information they need to gauge whether there is great promise here, or just more hype.",Misleading,False,False,0.1998894214630127

The perspective that some urologists may have once seen a """"financial windfall"""" in the use of hormone therapy, explaining some of the expansion in its use. One weakness:  The story could have (should have?) added the important point that screening for prostate cancer is not proven effective yet and remains controversial. One of the reasons so many elderly men are thrown into this difficult decision-making thicket is that the use of the PSA blood test has led to many men being diagnosed with prostate cancers of unknown significance, and leading many of them to pursue the hormone therapy that they felt rendered benefit without side effects.

19,HPV Shot Prevents Genital Warts in Boys and Men,"This story shows many strengths, and wisely sets a single research report from the New England Journal of Medicine inside a larger debate about whether thousands of young men should receive the costly vaccine Gardasil. The story wades into discussions of sexual orientation and even at what age an individual knows this truth about him or herself. These difficult topics are germane to the epidemiology of the many human papillomaviruses, and which people of both sexes are at highest risk from infection. Bravo for reading the editorial that accompanied the study article, and chasing down its author on deadline to get her comments. Bravo for asking “why” when confronted with the seemingly contradictory news that Gardasil can prevent genital warts but is not recommended by the CDC for universal prevention in young men. Since Gardasil (and competitor, Cervarix) debuted a few years ago, there have been heated disagreements about the price and most helpful distribution of the vaccines and whether both sexes should receive them. This major study, demonstrating effectiveness in young men, adds important information to complex questions of cost and prevention. But it needs to be reported in a way that provides some of the history and context for readers. HPV infection is transmitted sexually, so questions of prevention within the entire US population of men and women involve potentially vaccinating both sexes. However, both sexes are not at the same level of risk for potentially deadly cancers years later. Women bear the brunt of the health risks, but men can pass the infection to their partners and can suffer from cancerous and non-cancerous effects of the virus. This new study provides additional information for the ongoing discussion about the public health role of immunizing young men against HPV.",Misleading,True,False,0.21419882774353027

21,Shots more effective than FluMist in adults,"First, we acknowledge that the version of the AP story that we found in the Charlotte Observer was less than half the length (327 words) of the AP story as we found it in other newspapers (734 words). So the reporter clearly did a lot more work than what was seen in the Charlotte paper. This is a troubling practice that we've written about elsewhere on the site. Nonetheless, the article accurately summarizes the availability of flu vaccines and the primary results of the new study in the New England Journal of Medicine — the proportion of children protected from the flu by each of two tested vaccines (i.e. the vaccines’ absolute efficacy). However, the story could provide more information to help readers judge the meaning of these results, the novelty of the “new” live, inhaled vaccine, its potential harms and costs, the overall quality of the research, potential conflicts among the story’s sources, and other health measures readers can take to prevent the flu. The AP report omits mention of costs—a significant feature of any major public health initiative. It’s unfortunate that the article fails to put the data on vaccine efficacy into a meaningful context. To begin with, the advantage of the killed vaccine shots over the live FluMist vaccine was not statistically significant. But the fact the shots were just as good as the inhaled vaccine was surprising. The researchers note that the main virus they were concerned about (type A) had changed or “drifted” from the strain that was in the vaccine. Earlier studies had led them to expect that the inactivated vaccine shots would be less effective in this situation. Instead, the shots and nasal spraywere very effective (74% each, according to the new study). The killed virus was also very effective against two strains of type B virus. More information on potential harms might also allay fears associated with live vaccines. Side effects described in the New England Journal of Medicine study were mostly minor–runny nose, headache, cough, and muscle aches among those receiving the live nasal spray vaccine and sore arms among those receiving the shots. The study authors attributed one serious complication to the live (nasal) vaccine—acute pericarditis, or inflammation around the heart and major vessels—a problem that required hospitalization. A little more information about the story’s sources would also help readers assess the new research. The story (as it appeared in the Charlotte paper) quotes a single university-based vaccine expert, but does not state whether he has any potential conflicts of interest. The story fails to note that two researchers received consulting fees from pharmaceutical companies–including MedImmune, which manufactures the FluMist inhaled vaccine in partnership with the researchers’ employer, the University of Michigan. Finally, the AP report misses an opportunity to explain other measures people can take to prevent the flu. In addition to vaccination, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend several (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/habits.htm). These include using antiviral drugs and good health habits (e.g. avoid close contact; stay home when sick, cover your mouth and nose; clean your hands; avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth). It would be unfortunate if readers took away the message that flu prevention is not very effective or that a shot (or snort) has little value for the healthier members of a flu-prone community. What did the reporter put in the longer version of his story that you didn't read in the Charlotte paper? Quotes from two other physician-researchers. Caveats about interpreting the study results. Information from another flu study that appeared in the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Information from an editorial in that journal. Information on the age groups approved for use of FluMist. Information on the number of flu deaths (36,000) and hospitalizations (200,000/yr.) from the flu. In other words, you missed a lot. So this is more of a review of the editing done by the Charlotte newspaper that picked up the story off the wire than it is of the work of the original AP reporter.",Misleading,True,False,0.20594382286071777
22,HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT: TWO-WEEK DIET BETTER FOR DROPPING POUNDS,"This article describes a small and limited study (men only!) concluding that “intermittent” dieting that gives participants alternating cycles of two weeks of less restrictive weight-maintenance eating after two weeks of more restrictive calorie counts results in more weight loss over time. The article properly notes the potential benefits of such a plan–better compliance and some possible metabolic assist that prevents dieting “plateaus” that frustrate so many trying to lose pounds. But while the article acknowledges the flaws in most trendy diets, it doesn’t offer readers enough specific information to determine whether this variation on the dietary theme will work for them any better than any other diet. For example, it doesn’t say what the two arms of the intermittent diet included in actual calorie counts and/or foods; what the starting and ending average weights were for the study group; or even how the researchers kept track of what the participants were actually eating or doing other than (presumably) weighing them every two weeks. It’s hard to exaggerate the confusion, frustration, misinformation, disinformation, and potential harm perpetrated by the gazillion diets proffered by those with and without any scientific basis to the growing numbers of obese and overweight in the U.S. and worldwide.

44,Novel 'patient-friendly' colonoscopy prep shows excellent efficacy and safety,"This release summarizes an investigational study on a ‘novel’ colonoscopy bowel preparation under development by a Massachusetts-based company. The release claims that the prep is a more palatable regimen that includes solid food bars and low-volume beverages. Researchers report that by the end of the Stage 2 clinical trial, the regimen was as safe and effective as two currently available colonoscopy prep formulations in cleaning out the colon, and, importantly, participating trial volunteers gave the preparation a high rating. The release did a good job of describing the study and quantifying benefits. The existing preps that the novel formulation was compared against were never mentioned and that seems an important omission. The release also didn’t provide enough details about harms, or a ballpark cost estimate, which it seems reasonable to expect in almost all news releases. The study was presented at the American College of Gastroenterology’s 2016 annual meeting. The standard bowel preparation and prolonged fasting required to ensure a clean viewing field for the gastroentologist is daunting and has been suggested as a limiting factor in acceptance. For those approaching the magic age,  Dave Barry’s 2009 article in the Miami Herald provides a humorous look at this screening procedure. But the reality is that colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and individuals should have a discussion about the benefits and risks of the procedure. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years. Should the prep described in the release hold up throughout the clinical trial process, it may be welcomed by individuals facing a colonoscopy.",Misleading,True,False,0.20302248001098633

As we state below in our “Evidence” criterion: “We aren’t told if the symptom improvement is clinically meaningful. After all, IBS is a chronic condition and this is a short-term study. And most importantly, the reporting is confusing: “Changes in quality of life …..were not significantly different…. but all were much improved at the 3-month followup in the meditation group.”  And no explanation was given of how symptom changes were measured. Or what was meant by “all were much improved at the three-month followup.”  That’s a big weakness in the story.”  Many people are interested in non-medical approaches to improving health. Mindfulness meditation and other complemenary and alternative therapies, along with exercise and nutritional recommendations are of high interest.

59,"Regular painkillers work as well as opioids for sprains, strains and fractures","The news story reports on the findings of a recent study published in JAMA, which evaluated the effectiveness of four painkillers in addressing acute arm or leg pain in emergency room patients. One of the painkillers was a combination of the over-the-counter medications acetaminophen and ibuprofen; the other three painkillers were combinations of acetaminophen and an opioid (oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine). The study found that — within the two-hour window being evaluated — there was no statistical significant difference in the effectiveness of the four drugs, indicating that acetaminophen/ibuprofen is a viable alternative to opioids for addressing acute pain. The story is exceptionally concise — a news brief rather than a feature — but does a good job of describing the study and placing it in the context of the “opioid crisis” in the U.S. But much like a related news release, which we also reviewed, the story fails to place the findings in context with previous research on the relative efficacy of opioid and non-opioid painkillers. The story does a lot of things well, particularly given its brevity. It describes the study well and makes clear that the study is important because of the ongoing opioid crisis in the United States. As we noted when reviewing a news release on this study, the American Society of Addiction Medicine reports that at least 2 million Americans had an addiction to prescription painkillers in 2015 — and more than 20,000 people died from prescription painkiller overdoses in the same year. And data from the National Institute of Drug Abuse show that this problem is on the rise. However, any story about research findings will be stronger if it explains how new findings are consistent with or differ from previous research in the field. That may be especially true here.

One of the reasons so many elderly men are thrown into this difficult decision-making thicket is that the use of the PSA blood test has led to many men being diagnosed with prostate cancers of unknown significance, and leading many of them to pursue the hormone therapy that they felt rendered benefit without side effects.

72,HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT: TWO-WEEK DIET BETTER FOR DROPPING POUNDS,"This article describes a small and limited study (men only!) concluding that “intermittent” dieting that gives participants alternating cycles of two weeks of less restrictive weight-maintenance eating after two weeks of more restrictive calorie counts results in more weight loss over time. The article properly notes the potential benefits of such a plan–better compliance and some possible metabolic assist that prevents dieting “plateaus” that frustrate so many trying to lose pounds. But while the article acknowledges the flaws in most trendy diets, it doesn’t offer readers enough specific information to determine whether this variation on the dietary theme will work for them any better than any other diet. For example, it doesn’t say what the two arms of the intermittent diet included in actual calorie counts and/or foods; what the starting and ending average weights were for the study group; or even how the researchers kept track of what the participants were actually eating or doing other than (presumably) weighing them every two weeks.

79,New method could make IVF more effective,"This year’s Nobel Prize in Medicine went to Robert Edwards, a UK physiologist who, over 30 years ago, developed the technique for in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Since then, IVF has become an enourmous industry. An individual cycle of IVF can cost $10-15,000 but the average chance of success is roughly 1 in 5 (varying widely according to many factors). Therefore, any improvements in the technique to improve the success rate is welcome news to potential parents. This story reports on a new technique that entails observing the embryo divide and develop to attempt to predict which ones would have the highest chance of success. While this method may be truly an advancement in IVF technology, this story does little to educate readers on its potential importance. It provides inadequate information about the availability, costs and potential harms of IVF. It does not discuss the strength of the evidence to support the new technique nor does it describe the success rates of the procedure compared to existing methods.

90,"Regular painkillers work as well as opioids for sprains, strains and fractures","The news story reports on the findings of a recent study published in JAMA, which evaluated the effectiveness of four painkillers in addressing acute arm or leg pain in emergency room patients. One of the painkillers was a combination of the over-the-counter medications acetaminophen and ibuprofen; the other three painkillers were combinations of acetaminophen and an opioid (oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine). The study found that — within the two-hour window being evaluated — there was no statistical significant difference in the effectiveness of the four drugs, indicating that acetaminophen/ibuprofen is a viable alternative to opioids for addressing acute pain. The story is exceptionally concise — a news brief rather than a feature — but does a good job of describing the study and placing it in the context of the “opioid crisis” in the U.S. But much like a related news release, which we also reviewed, the story fails to place the findings in context with previous research on the relative efficacy of opioid and non-opioid painkillers. The story does a lot of things well, particularly given its brevity. It describes the study well and makes clear that the study is important because of the ongoing opioid crisis in the United States. As we noted when reviewing a news release on this study, the American Society of Addiction Medicine reports that at least 2 million Americans had an addiction to prescription painkillers in 2015 — and more than 20,000 people died from prescription painkiller overdoses in the same year. And data from the National Institute of Drug Abuse show that this problem is on the rise. However, any story about research findings will be stronger if it explains how new findings are consistent with or differ from previous research in the field. That may be especially true here. If this story aimed to highlight the finding that non-opioid painkillers are comparable in effectiveness to opioid painkillers, it could have mentioned any of several studies (cited in the journal article) that had similar findings in post-surgical settings.",Misleading,True,False,0.2042384147644043

93,Shots more effective than FluMist in adults,"First, we acknowledge that the version of the AP story that we found in the Charlotte Observer was less than half the length (327 words) of the AP story as we found it in other newspapers (734 words). So the reporter clearly did a lot more work than what was seen in the Charlotte paper. This is a troubling practice that we've written about elsewhere on the site. Nonetheless, the article accurately summarizes the availability of flu vaccines and the primary results of the new study in the New England Journal of Medicine — the proportion of children protected from the flu by each of two tested vaccines (i.e. the vaccines’ absolute efficacy). However, the story could provide more information to help readers judge the meaning of these results, the novelty of the “new” live, inhaled vaccine, its potential harms and costs, the overall quality of the research, potential conflicts among the story’s sources, and other health measures readers can take to prevent the flu. The AP report omits mention of costs—a significant feature of any major public health initiative. It’s unfortunate that the article fails to put the data on vaccine efficacy into a meaningful context. To begin with, the advantage of the killed vaccine shots over the live FluMist vaccine was not statistically significant. But the fact the shots were just as good as the inhaled vaccine was surprising. The researchers note that the main virus they were concerned about (type A) had changed or “drifted” from the strain that was in the vaccine. Earlier studies had led them to expect that the inactivated vaccine shots would be less effective in this situation. Instead, the shots and nasal spraywere very effective (74% each, according to the new study). The killed virus was also very effective against two strains of type B virus. More information on potential harms might also allay fears associated with live vaccines. Side effects described in the New England Journal of Medicine study were mostly minor–runny nose, headache, cough, and muscle aches among those receiving the live nasal spray vaccine and sore arms among those receiving the shots. The study authors attributed one serious complication to the live (nasal) vaccine—acute pericarditis, or inflammation around the heart and major vessels—a problem that required hospitalization. A little more information about the story’s sources would also help readers assess the new research. The story (as it appeared in the Charlotte paper) quotes a single university-based vaccine expert, but does not state whether he has any potential conflicts of interest. The story fails to note that two researchers received consulting fees from pharmaceutical companies–including MedImmune, which manufactures the FluMist inhaled vaccine in partnership with the researchers’ employer, the University of Michigan. Finally, the AP report misses an opportunity to explain other measures people can take to prevent the flu. In addition to vaccination, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend several (http://www.cdc.gov/flu/protect/habits.htm). These include using antiviral drugs and good health habits (e.g. avoid close contact; stay home when sick, cover your mouth and nose; clean your hands; avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth). It would be unfortunate if readers took away the message that flu prevention is not very effective or that a shot (or snort) has little value for the healthier members of a flu-prone community. What did the reporter put in the longer version of his story that you didn't read in the Charlotte paper? Quotes from two other physician-researchers. Caveats about interpreting the study results. Information from another flu study that appeared in the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Information from an editorial in that journal. Information on the age groups approved for use of FluMist. Information on the number of flu deaths (36,000) and hospitalizations (200,000/yr.) from the flu. In other words, you missed a lot. So this is more of a review of the editing done by the Charlotte newspaper that picked up the story off the wire than it is of the work of the original AP reporter.",Misleading,True,False,0.20168304443359375

This appears to be a novel way of treating IBS, and the fact that symptoms improved at all is of interest, even if the duration of the study was short.

Many current genetic tests focus on seeking individual genes that have been changed. The story needed more caution–there are plenty of unknowns here. For example, even if a person knows their score, there’s no proof that having that number will improve health outcomes. What, for example, should a person do if they find out they’re at high risk for heart disease, but don’t have any signs of it? Also, false-positive and false-negative results could be significant. Predicting a person’s risk for serious and life-threatening diseases is valuable, both to the individual and to public health. So any refined improvement in how we gauge that risk is a true benefit.

114,Lap Band Surgery Benefits Very Obese Adolescents,"This news release summarizes an Australian study of the effect of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery (placing an adjustable silicone band around the top part of the stomach) on 21 severely obese adolescents. The release states that two-thirds of the teens lost significant amounts of weight for up to five years and further describes the procedure as “a first option” to manage obesity during adolescence. Researchers quoted in the text repeatedly and appropriately cautioned that the procedure “is not for everyone” and requires careful management, but the release remained determinedly cheery about the outcome. Importantly, it also failed to acknowledge the small sample size in this study and the lack of a control group,  as well as the health complications that stymied a few of the participants. Also ignored was that one-third of the 21 participants either failed to lose weight or began to regain it over the course of the study. Lap band surgery for severely obese teens is clearly no panacea. Obesity is a major health problem the world over, with nearly 14% of American teens identified as obese (2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System). Obesity brings with it significant physical and psychological problems, with teenagers extremely susceptible to the latter and looking for solutions that do not require behavior change. Any text advising a surgical solution for a non-surgical problem in adolescents must be grounded in sufficient data and, with even that caveat fulfilled, must be cautiously worded to make it clear that most overweight teens would be inappropriate candidates for the procedure.
