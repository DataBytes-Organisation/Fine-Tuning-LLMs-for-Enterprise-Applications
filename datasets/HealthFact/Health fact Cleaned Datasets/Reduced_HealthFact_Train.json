{"claim_id":9192,"claim":"Phase III COMPASS study with Bayer’s Rivaroxaban in Patients with Coronary or Peripheral Artery Disease Shows Overwhelming Efficacy and Meets Primary Endpoint Early","explanation":"This release touts the end of the biggest clinical trial to date on the drug Xarelto (rivaroxaban), used to prevent major adverse cardiac events such as heart attacks and strokes in people with coronary artery disease or peripheral artery disease. As we found with a recent release on the drug Repatha (which we also reviewed), this release does not provide findings from the study but instead acts more like a preview for the findings to be released at an upcoming scientific meeting. The release describes the study parameters (number enrolled, dosage, time frame, etc.) and discusses in clear detail the drug’s availability. But it left out potential harms from Xarelto and it also doesn’t cover the drug’s costs, talk about any of the specific benefits of the drug, or compare it to other treatments. In short, it’s like a Superbowl ad for the drug without the all the fast-talking caveats at the end. For a more general discussion of data-free drug announcements see Managing Editor Kevin Lomangino’s recent post on a “troubling PR trend.”    Coronary artery and peripheral vascular disease are both common and will continue to become more common as the population lives longer. Medications to prevent new heart attacks or loss of limbs due to peripheral artery disease are always welcome (though prevention would be cheaper). Even when drug makers are required to disclose when it reaches “primary endpoints,” it’s to the benefit of investors, regulators, the medical community and hopeful patients to avoid hyping the results, emphasize study limitations, and highlight the lack of vetting by peers. That context is going missing in a number of announcements from big drug companies.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":8989,"claim":"BCG vaccine leads to long-term blood sugar improvement in type 1 diabetes patients","explanation":"This release summarizes a phase I clinical trial that looks at the effect of bacillus Calmette-Guérin (BCG) vaccine on hemoglobin levels (HbA1c) in 52 adults with type I diabetes and 230 people who received no treatment but contributed blood samples. HbA1c is a measure of average blood sugar levels over the preceding three months. The study documented moderate reductions in HbA1c during the last 5 years of this 8-year study. The release would have been improved had it included absolute rather than relative numbers and a clarification of whether study participants were on insulin at the time of the study. Other factors could have contributed to the reduction of HbA1c levels over an 8-year period. The STAT story on this same research, which we also reviewed, focused on a smaller group of 9 patients who’ve been followed for more than 5 years. Type I diabetes accounts for about 5-10% of all diabetes and can occur in both adults and children. It’s believed to be caused primarily by the auto-immune destruction of the insulin-producing (beta) cells of the pancreas, making people who have it dependent on injected insulin.There is currently no cure for type 1 diabetes aside from pancreatic transplant. It’s important to bear in mind that HbA1c levels are commonly used as a  surrogate marker in diabetes research. Reductions in this marker don’t necessarily equate with less complications or better outcomes in people with either type I or type 2 diabetes and studies using HbA1c as an intermediate outcome have been limited by their short follow-up and linkage to long-term, clinically meaningful, outcomes.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":11193,"claim":"Healthy Diet May Help Kidney Disease Patients Live Longer","explanation":"This is the perfect example of a news release that cries out for deeper explanation of the study it’s based on, but ends up being given short shrift by the journal publishing the research. The possibility that an overall healthy diet could lead to significantly better health outcomes for people suffering from chronic kidney disease is an important contribution to the science around diet, and yet we are not given quite enough facts or context about the study to know how to evaluate the power of the findings. The published report is an analysis of seven previously completed studies. The analysis set out to look for any associations between dietary patterns and kidney failure or mortality among adults with chronic kidney disease. As we keep reminding readers when news releases and news articles don’t mention it: association does not equal causation. The release would also have benefited from a mention of possible harms, and a discussion of cost, alternatives and what makes the finding novel. Outcomes in chronic kidney disease are exceptionally poor, and any potential lifestyle modification that can attenuate this risk has significant public health implications.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9569,"claim":"MICHIGAN ATHLETIC GROUP SAYS CONCUSSION PROGRAM WORKS","explanation":"Concussions incurred during sporting events in middle and high schools may have substantial health impacts on young athletes. Recognition of those impacts has grown exponentially in the US, generating earnest efforts to find ways to diagnose possible problems during games, before an athlete returns to the fray and runs the risk of making things worse. A number of companies now market baseline testing products, which usually involve a “baseline” neurological exam at the start of the season. Later, if the athlete is injured during a game, a shorter “sideline” exam can be conducted to compare to the original exam. This AP story reports on a Michigan-based organization that made baseline testing available to schools in order to gather data over the course of a year about the frequency of potential concussions across ages, genders and type of sport. The story does a nice job of summarizing the results of that study but treats the concept of baseline testing uncritically. Can the brief sideline diagnostic efforts in the midst of a game actually detect a problem in the making? It depends on who you “ask.” Baseline testing is currently fashionable in medical circles. The Journal of the American Association (JAMA) has published articles concluding that baseline procedures are valid tests of cognitive function in athletes, a conclusion disputed by articles in other journals. The CDC has a webpage explaining baseline testing that offers details about when to do the tests but with no efficacy critique. And web pages from “The Sports Concussion Institute” tout the testing as evidence-based. But is it? We could find no controlled trials showing that neuropsychological testing improves outcomes after sports-related concussions. And that, in turn, may mean that baseline testing is still a form of expert opinion masquerading as evidence-based science. Since companies are selling baseline testing products, the possibility of industry influence on the conduct of research exists. These details were needed in the to story to present a full picture of what’s at stake. Sports-related head injuries are increasingly implicated in permanent brain damage. Determining their frequency and potential severity while there is still time to treat or, ideally, avoid the problem is critical.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9626,"claim":"Statins 'could be valuable addition to breast cancer treatment'","explanation":"This story springs from a recent lab study in the UK showing that breast cancer cells can use cholesterol molecules to mimic estrogen in order to grow, offering a potential reason why some breast cancers resist standard anti-hormone treatments. The headline makes a quantum leap in logic in declaring that statin drugs used to lower cholesterol “could be valuable addition to breast cancer treatment.” Similarly, the opening paragraph states that researchers “have raised the possibility of using statins” to stop breast cancer recurrence. That’s rampant speculation, not supported by the research being reported on, and the story should have clarified this. Offering hope that a potential new discovery could curb recurrence makes for intriguing journalism, but if not framed correctly, it is a disservice to breast cancer survivors, especially with such nascent science. More than 2.8 million U.S. women have been diagnosed with breast cancer. After initial treatment, breast cancers that have a large number of estrogen receptors — which constitute the majority of cases — can continue to be treated with hormone therapies such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, which help prevent recurrence by cutting off hormones that feed the cancer cells. But resistance to these drugs remains a problem. About a third of women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer experience a recurrence, often more than five years after the initial diagnosis and treatment. For many breast cancer survivors, the chance of recurrence constitutes an ongoing trauma.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10523,"claim":"Prenatal blood test for Down syndrome shows high level of accuracy","explanation":"Overall, this story didn’t provide some of the key information readers need to make sense out of this study on a new blood test for Down syndrome. We wanted to see cost information, hear some good independent commentary on the study and, above all, read some context about why this test is worth any ink at all. Doing testing for 824 screenings, of which 11% were technical failures, is not a proof of concept yet for what would need to be millions of tests nationally and thousands per clinical lab if used in clinical practice. This story needed more context to give people the proper context to understand that. Screening for genetic anomalies during pregnancy can be stressful for expectant mothers. They dread that they will find out something is wrong with their baby, and they also dread that the test itself will cause them to miscarry. This story helps women understand the long odds that either of those scenarios will happen, and it goes part of the way toward helping them understand the importance of these new findings. But the story does conflate the screening and diagnostic process beginning with the first paragraph when it links the new test with “prenatal testing” done by amniocentesis and chorionic villus sampling. This new test is not a diagnostic test, as those tests are. Rather, as the authors of the BMJ paper confirm, it is a “screen for fetal trisomy 21 among high risk pregnancies.” This is a “hope for the future” level test that may be inching its way to market. It’s not available now and won’t be in the immediate future.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9437,"claim":"More than 103 million Americans will have high blood pressure under new guidelines","explanation":"This story about new guidelines from the American Heart Association and other medical groups that reduce the threshold for diagnosis of high blood pressure summarizes the key recommendations, but doesn’t explain benefits, harms or costs. This story (along with those from many other news media outlets) should have addressed the glaring disconnect between what is recommended and what doctors and patients actually do. The story used far lower estimates of the number of people likely to be told to start taking drugs than what was contained in an American Heart Association news release. (And the online and video versions of the ABC News stories used very different numbers.) Readers of this story learn that they are more likely to be told they have high blood pressure, but not what that means to them, other than that they will probably hear more lectures about diet and exercise, and maybe get more drug prescriptions. For a good alternative view, see the this New York Times opinion piece. If almost all of the “new” patients with high blood pressure will be simply advised to improve their lifestyle, by doing things like exercising more, eating better and drinking less alcohol, which are things everyone is advised to do, then what has really changed? Any time that medical experts spout the routine lifestyle advice, reporters should press them to explain what is really likely to change for patients. Will physicians and clinics adopt (and will insurers pay for) more effective lifestyle interventions? Or will it be business as usual for most patients, except that more people will be prescribed drugs?","label":"MISLEADING"}

Because their benefits and potential harms are so often barely known, and because their impacts are frequently confined to “subsets” of patients in clinical trials, the overall result is a see-saw of hope and despair that journalists find challenging to report and put into context. The anti-inflammatory effects of a Novartis drug called canakinumab is the latest case in point. TIME magazine’s description of clinical trial results, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, unfortunately fails to address the modest benefits, and the substantial risks and costs, of the drug. This is in contrast to a Reuters story on the same study that takes a far more cautious, cautionary and calibrated tone that better serves readers. The anti-inflammatory scientific arc is littered with the consequences of less-than-stellar clinical results, overblown expectations and pharmaceutical industry high-stakes business gambles.

Some have said that it’s difficult to make the claim that the drug stops periods when women still get bleeding like this – bleeding that is uNPRedictable. While the story made an attempt to put the new drug into context of other attempts by many women to control their periods with other products already on the market, the story would have been improved with more hard evidence and more scrutiny of the quality of the evidence.

The news release says the initial research was funded by the charity Cancer Research UK and the drug was licensed to Irish biotechnology firm Carrick Therapeutics, which is has begun conducting a safety study. Laudably, the headline and the body of the news release caution that this isn’t a proven treatment. But there’s far more hype here than substance. The news release lauds researchers for quick action and offers a quote about how “exciting” it is that academia and industry “are bringing urgently needed new tests and treatments to patients.” But there’s no mention that Imperial College London has a patent on this drug. There’s also no discussion of how many patients might benefit from this, or acknowledgement of the extremely high prices for new cancer drugs. The high cost of new cancer drugs, some of which offer only marginal benefits, is strangling healthcare budgets around the world even though initial research is often funded by government agencies and charities.

{"claim_id":9707,"claim":"Coffee could literally be a lifesaver","explanation":"This CNN story describes yet another observational study of the possible links between coffee consumption and health, this one concluding that overall, whether decaf or regular, coffee drinking is linked to reduced risk of death from heart disease, diabetes, and neurological disorders such as Parkinson’s Disease, although not cancer. The headline — “Coffee could literally be a lifesaver” — is overblown given the types of evidence we’re talking about. But the story otherwise does a worthy and responsible job of framing the study’s weaknesses and strengths, particularly so in explaining confounding factors and why so many coffee studies historically have yielded “murky” results. It also takes a pretty good stab at exploring the study’s suggestion that natural chemicals in the coffee may be responsible for the beverage’s potential health benefits, an effort that was essentially missing from a story in STAT that was otherwise much stronger in describing the strengths and weaknesses of this and all observational studies. The CNN story also aptly noted the novel analysis of coffee drinking in a non-smoking subset of the nearly 200,000 subjects. Overall, this CNN piece could have been made stronger by having outside experts comment on the findings, as the STAT piece did to excellent effect; by offering more qualitative details about the sources of the data; by noting that in excessive quantities, the new study identified a slight increase in risk of death; and — as the STAT piece did superbly, noting the likely “benefits” in terms of absolute risk (very, very small). Readers and viewers of mass media have been nearly whiplashed by claims and counterclaims related to the benefits and risks of coffee drinking. A few studies over the past several decades have concluded that, at least in large amounts, coffee can be “toxic,” but most of the coverage has focused on the drink’s possible health benefits, but in ways that led to substantial confusion. The new analysis, described in the American Heart Association journal Circulation, has some significant statistical assets not present in previous studies, including a subset analysis of non-smokers’ death risks. Its central finding — that coffee safely confers health benefits (essentially reduced death risks for some major categories of disease) even in relatively high doses among non-smokers — is likely to be reassuring to coffee addicts — and their physicians.","label":"MISLEADING"}

Rove since said he was wrong about the length of her hospital stay. The actual number is four days. By describing a long hospital stay and tying it to signs of traumatic brain injury, Rove associated Clinton with a more profound medical episode. Experts reject that association. Concussions are the mildest form of traumatic brain injury. The glasses Clinton wore are an optional treatment for temporary problems of double vision that are relatively common among people who suffer concussions along with other conditions. She has not worn the glasses for some time, and the neurologists we contacted said most people recover fully.

{"claim_id":8941,"claim":"Extract from soursop leaves can prevent the symptoms of fibromyalgia","explanation":"This news release covers a study that tested whether a tropical plant extract improves fibromyalgia symptoms in rats. It says the study of soursop — also known as graviola or guanabana — was published, but doesn’t say where. We couldn’t find it. The release feeds rampant misinformation about this plant, falsely announcing that soursop extract is a remedy for chronic pain, anxiety and depression associated with fibromyalgia and can improve the lives of patients with that very common condition. Not until two-thirds of the way into the text do we learn those claims are based on a rat study. There’s no specific data about the findings, no caution about harms, and no mention that benefits found in animal studies seldom translate to humans. Nor does it mention the plant’s widespread availability — a situation we find worrisome given unproven medical claims that glut the internet. In sum, this one left us with a very bad taste in our mouths. Fibromyalgia can be difficult to treat effectively. The condition is not uncommon, and although evidence-based treatment is available, the goal is symptom management. Many patients are interested in “natural remedies” to avoid long-term reliance on prescription medicines. But news releases based on animal studies are obligated to alert these interested readers that positive findings don’t yet apply to humans. We hold not only the university responsible for this news release, but the American Association for the Advancement of Science, whose EurekAlert! news release service disseminates releases for a fee, but does not enforce standards that would prevent such weak releases from being disseminated worldwide by their service.

Also, it doesn’t mention that four of the authors have applied for a patent on the related technology. Quicker, cheaper detection of neurological diseases might be good for individual patients, or it might not. News releases about such advances will be read by patients and their families and should strive to discuss the impact of early diagnosis, beyond the potential benefits for research.

{"claim_id":9730,"claim":"Combination Drug May Ease the Agitation of Alzheimer’s","explanation":"This short piece in the Well blog describes positive results of a 10-week randomized clinical trial, published in JAMA last week, testing a currently marketed combination of the drugs dextromethorphan and quinidine against placebo for the treatment of agitation and aggression in patients with Alzheimer’s disease. While it manages to provide some insight into the study with its scant 226 words, the story also presents readers with an overly optimistic view of the findings, omits discussion of the high costs of this drug, and never clues readers into the potential conflicts of interest at play. The accompanying editorial in the same edition of JAMA provides a more realistic view of the study and its importance; “… the data from the study by Cummings et al are important, but not overwhelming, and a second independent study with longer duration is needed to confirm the treatment effect.”   This matters because as the population ages, an increasing number of people will inevitably develop dementia, including Alzheimer’s, which is estimated to occur in about 5 million people today (according to the National Institute on Aging). As the dementia progresses, it’s not uncommon for people to develop agitated and even aggressive behaviors towards loved ones and caregivers. Behavioral interventions and changes to the environment don’t always help sufficiently, so drug interventions are sought. Stories about these treatments should provide a balanced and realistic view of study findings, as many patients, families, and caregivers are desperate for something that might help.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10433,"claim":"Impact of first federally funded anti-smoking ad campaign remains strong after three years","explanation":"CDC Tips ad campaign features advice from former smokersThis news release focuses on a recent study that evaluates the effectiveness of a 2014 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) educational advertising campaign called “Tips From Former Smokers” (Tips) that aimed to encourage and help cigarette smokers quit smoking. The release highlights the health risks associated with smoking and the estimated effectiveness of the ad campaign. The release also argues that the Tips campaign was a cost-effective means of helping people quit smoking. It provides some good background data on the health-related costs of smoking as well as estimates on how many people were reached through the ad campaign. However, the release does not give readers a hard number on the campaign’s cost. It would also have been good to know how the effectiveness of the Tips campaign compared to other “quit smoking” efforts. There are few activities as closely tied to adverse health outcomes as cigarette smoking. As the CDC notes (on its site, not in the release), “cigarette smoking harms nearly every organ of the body.” Smoking is linked to significantly increased risks of stroke, heart disease and lung cancer, with close to 500,000 deaths each year attributed to smoking in the United States. Smoking is not only a national health issue, but a global health issue. A 2015 study estimated that, globally, cigarette smoking causes approximately $500 billion in economic damage (largely through health costs) each year. For these reasons, finding effective means to help cigarette users stop smoking is clearly of widespread interest. However, that means taking a critical look at just how well anti-smoking campaigns actually work. And one way to do that is through the lens of a cost-benefit analysis, and comparing the outcomes of multiple campaigns. This release would have been stronger if it had helped readers make the necessary comparisons.","label":"MISLEADING"}

Instead of allowing a sense of hyperbole to permeate, as we saw in other coverage of the same study, we were glad to see many of the appropriate caveats included. The story should have been more specific about the enormous hazards of bone marrow transplants and told readers of their high cost. The word cure, even when surrounded by quote marks certainly gets one’s attention. Applied to a story about HIV and AIDS, it is an attention-grabber. Despite the arguable hyperbole on the part of the German researchers, the story is interesting because it adds to the suggestion that the CCR5 mutation may represent an approach to eradication of the virus. This story, like others on the topic, spent a fair amount of time explaining the difficulty in broadly applying stem cell transplants to AIDS patients and leukemia patients and talked with the appropriate experts. It serves as a good lesson, in many ways, for reporters covering studies with limited results and stacked odds of long term success.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":11349,"claim":"Vitamin D, The Surprise Powerhouse: Wonder pill.

It was overzealous in describing purported benefits but did call for caution. The scientists quoted are all leaders in the field. The article would have been much stronger if it had not had so much hyperbole (“Wonder Pill. Really.” in the headline?) and was better organized. It should also have included information about potential harm and cost. While it is true that by its very definition as a vitamin, vitamin D is a substance required by the body for optimal function, the article could have done a cleaner job of separating demonstrated benefits of vitamin D from some of the hyperbole. Educating about this vitamin, and highlighting some of the reasons why many people don’t have adequate vitamin D levels would have resulted in a more informative, balanced piece. It would have given the reader a frame work for thinking about what their own levels might be and what that means to them in terms of disease risk. The story comes close to disease-mongering at several points. At the end of the article, a physician says that at his osteoporosis clinic, they “just assume that every patient is [vitamin D] deficient”. It also quotes a recent review as stating that vitamin D deficiency is “a largely unrecognized epidemic in many populations worldwide.” But the article also tempers some of the “excitement” about vitamin D by saying “Much of vitamin D’s potential is still just that: potential.” And the story included a section labeled “a call for caution” with a quote, “Too many people expect nutrients to work like drugs…That kind of approach is likely to lead to disappointment.”  Overall, the number of sources and perspectives was excellent, as was the citation of several studies.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":9160,"claim":"Investigational dose of oral interferon-free treatment can cure hepatitis C in children","explanation":"This news release from the European Association for the Study of the Liver (EASL) heralding the safety and efficacy of a combination drug therapy for children with hepatitis C does a good job in several areas. It explains the scope of benefits and harms, how the study was conducted, and how the therapy could improve treatment options for kids with this contagious disease. On the other hand, the news release overlooks discussion of the enormous cost of this therapy and of potential adverse effects that may emerge when the therapy is used in a large population. We also disagree with its use of the sensational words “cure” and “breakthrough.” Editor’s note: This review contains an update under the benefits criteria that adds a caution about not equating reduced viral load with a cure. One estimate puts the incidence of chronic hepatitis C infection in U.S. children at between 23,000 and 46,000. Pediatric hepatitis C is usually contracted at birth from mothers with a history of IV drug abuse. More than one-third of infected kids eventually develop a life threatening long-term liver disease. Approving more effective and safer treatment options for these kids — options that are already available to adults — would be an important benefit.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":9278,"claim":"New rapid diagnostic test for Ebola could be game changer in the fight against the disease","explanation":"This release from the The Lancet plays up a first-of-its-kind rapid diagnostic test for Ebola virus disease (EVD). We’re told the ReEBOV Antigen Rapid Test (made by Corgenix) could be a powerful future tool in detecting, monitoring, and controlling outbreaks of EVD. The excitement stems from a recent field study conducted during an Ebola outbreak. After that trial, the release explains, clinicians found the test to be faster than and as reliable as the current standard method for detecting EVD, called real-time reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). The release helpfully quantifies both the sensitivity and specificity of the test, giving readers a thorough overview of the test’s performance both in identifying cases of Ebola and ruling it out in people who don’t have it. What’s more, the release tells us, the new rapid-diagnostic test requires just a drop of blood instead a vial of blood, and takes minutes to get a result instead of days. The new test sounds like a potentially critical new tool in rapidly diagnosing EVD, but it has strings attached. The release does disclose these caveats — e.g. the test missed some early cases, it requires refrigeration, and it’s ability to detect EVD early on is limited. Our wish list for this otherwise very complete release includes context about how deadly EVD is and how it’s transmitted; what the symptoms are; what regions its endemic to; etc. We’d also like to know a bit about the regulatory side of things — which of these tests have been approved, and what are the roadblocks to approval\/bringing the test to the field? On average, the Ebola virus kills about half of the people it infects. Recent outbreaks in Africa have claimed tens of thousands of lives. Although standard diagnostic tests take hours to process, it might take days for samples to reach a lab from remote places where an outbreak is happening. In addition, there have been reports in Guinea of potentially infected individuals not wanting to travel for testing due to a cultural mistrust of authority figures. So any fast and reliable diagnostic test — especially one requiring only a finger prick — could help workers on the ground detect and control the spread of an outbreak, as well as reduce the risk of infection to themselves (since Ebola virus spreads through bodily fluids).","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":9117,"claim":"Earlier blood testing for iron deficiency, anemia recommended for young women","explanation":"This release reports on two separate studies, one combing the medical histories and records of more than 6,000 women, and another where 96 patients were surveyed. In the first study, researchers found that a significant number of young women had iron deficiency that wasn’t quite as severe as anemia. In the second study, they tried to find a way to predict who might have iron deficiency by asking about fatigue and other factors, but were unable to find a predictive question. The release declares that doctors should screen all teens for “iron deficiency” but this conclusion seems beyond the scope of the two studies. Finding teens who may suffer health issues from iron deficiency is a great goal. However, whether universal screening is the best way requires further research. For more context about the potential harms of over-screening, see this blog post from our archives. Screening every 16-year-old girl in the US for “iron deficiency” may not be the best idea. This news release goes too far in reporting on two studies about iron deficiency, which is a health issue for some teens. Readers are not given any balancing context on whether the screening could cause anxiety or lead to false-positive diagnoses that could lead to unnecessary treatment. These studies were exploratory and attempt to identify factors that medical staff could use to more selectively screen teens (or screen earlier) for iron deficiency. The American Academy of Pediatrics does not recommend routine screening for anemia. The release stated that several adverse associations exist with anemia (lower math scores, poor attention) but those are likely associated with more severe anemia and it is not clear that the relationship is causal. In fact, screening more aggressively for iron deficiency could result in over-treatment.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10391,"claim":"UT Southwestern research shows 98 percent cure rate for prostate cancer using SBRT","explanation":"This news release draws from a Phasel\/ll safety study of 91 patients who were given a concentrated form of higher-dose radiation known as stereotactic body radiation therapy, or SBRT, instead of typical radiation therapy for early-stage prostate cancer. The study was designed to test the toxicity of increasing levels of radiation, not to assess the survival rate. While the five-year study showed benefits, the release failed to provide the numbers and details that we believe would help readers understand the risks vs. benefits. The “cure” rate referred just to men who had no evidence of rising prostate-specific antigen (PSA) — and the study acknowledges that most men were not actually followed for 5 years so a “cure rate” was statistically estimated. However, over a third of the men had low-risk cancer where the 5-year cancer-specific survival is estimated to be 100 percent. It’s not certain that these men actually required treatment. The National Cancer Institute estimates there will be about 180,890 new cases of prostate cancer diagnosed in the United States this year. Some of them will be treated with active surveillance, the “watch and wait” treatment. More aggressive cancers may require surgery, radiation or chemotherapy. Among those treated with radiation, stereotactic radiotherapy (SBRT), an alternative form of radiation therapy described in this release, may offer a shorter course of treatment (five sessions) compared to external beam radiation therapy which is typically delivered over the course of about six weeks. The shorter SBRT approach suggests an important convenience benefit to patients. Treatment toxicity with this procedure was also low, according to the release, although there was no control group in the study to compare it with.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9317,"claim":"Artificial intelligence can predict Alzheimer’s 6 years earlier than medics, study finds","explanation":"This brief, 375-word story published by Fox News was sourced from The Sun. It describes a study using an artificial intelligence algorithm to recognize patterns from brain scans. The story at least warns readers that because of the small study size (just 40 subjects), larger studies would be needed to know if the reported “100% accuracy” for predicting Alzheimer’s six years before diagnosis, can actually be replicated. But beyond that, the story is full of holes and canned quotes. The news release was far more informative. Early diagnosis of Alzheimer’s is a popular research area at this time. Stories about it often highlight the presumption that “catching” Alzheimer’s early will help doctors slow or stop the disease “before it starts.” Although this may have intuitive appeal there is currently no evidence to suggest this is currently feasible, or even possible in the near future. It’s an important point that should be made in all stories touching on both early diagnosis and “prevention” of this degenerative neurologic disease. This sort of framing runs a huge risk of misleading patients and their caregivers and — perhaps more disturbing — providing false hope based on what are usually preliminary findings that are by no means conclusive.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":9606,"claim":"Stem cell study for ALS patients shows promise, yet causes pain","explanation":"A man with ALS participates in a fundraiser for research in New York City. This story describes a small Phase 2 safety-focused trial of stem cell injections to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), also known as Lou Gehrig’s disease. The trial involving 15 patients tested whether the stem cell injections, previously performed in low doses at Emory University, would be safe in progressively larger doses administered at multiple medical centers. The study was published in the journal Neurology. There isn’t much news here; the question remains open as to whether stem cells could be a safe and effective therapy for ALS. Nothing from these studies suggest that this treatment may slow or reverse progression of ALS. Given that, the story did a good job outlining the harms and risks from the procedure, and it included quotes from independent experts. But it is another example of how stem cell therapies get news coverage, even when the research is still preliminary. ALS is a rapidly progressive, fatal disease that attacks the nerve cells that control muscles. It’s relatively rare, with 3.9 cases in every 100,000 Americans, according to the National Institutes of Health. Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure, usually within 3 to 5 years from the onset of symptoms, according to the NIH, though about 10 percent of those with ALS survive for 10 or more years. There is no cure, though the drug riluzole can prolong survival. Converting patients’ stem cells into healthy motor neurons is one ongoing research pathway for a possible treatment. The concept of replacing these dying spinal nerve cells with new ones seems intuitively appealing, but it is unknown whether this could slow the progression or ideally reverse it.","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":9638,"claim":"What Teen Girls Should Eat to Reduce Breast Cancer Risk","explanation":"This story focuses primarily on a May 11 paper published in the BMJ, which reported that eating more fruit (particularly during adolescence) was associated with a decreased risk of breast cancer for women. A healthy diet and breast cancer risk reduction are worthy topics, but the story doesn’t touch on some important points — such as the fact that a previous study in Pediatrics by the same researchers, using the same cohort data, pointed to adolescent dietary fiber intake as a significant factor in reducing breast cancer risk. We also were confused by the data discussion: What does a 25% reduction actually mean? Without absolute numbers, we’re just not sure. As we noted in our story reviews related to the earlier Pediatrics study, the CDC reports that breast cancer is the most common cancer in women in the United States — with more than 224,000 new cases reported in 2012 alone. Research findings that identify new ways to reduce the incidence of breast cancer are newsworthy, particularly when the new health measures may also have significant ancillary health benefits — as is likely the case with consuming a diet high in fruits.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":11061,"claim":"Calcium scores and heart disease","explanation":"This is a story about a method of screening for heart disease. Though the story mentioned that there are some experts who believe that the test is being overused, there was no direct comment about this to explain why overuse of a test is problematic. The story did mention that the test was for individuals who were at high risk, though it did not explicitly define what would put someone at high risk. The story did not provide insight into the evidence about the impact of coronary artery calcium on the risk of heart disease. It did not present information about the magnitude of benefit that might be attained with this test. Although there was some discussion about whether the test is used too often, there was little mention of the population for whom the test might provide useful insight about an elevated risk. The story failed to mention an estimate of how much an elevated calcium score affects risk, for example, of having a heart attack or sudden cardiac death. There was no discussion about the harms of treatment. This test does expose the patient to a small amount of radiation. It would be suggested that a woman who is pregnant or might be pregnant be sure to discuss this prior to the test. There is a chance that the test might appear positive even though there are no blockages of coronary arteries. As a result, the person might have additional testing that is unnecessary and that carries its own potential risks and side effects. Additionally – there may also be the harm of incidental non-cardiac findings. The story did not put the new test into the context of existing tests.

{"claim_id":9244,"claim":"Novel 'patient-friendly' colonoscopy prep shows excellent efficacy and safety","explanation":"This release summarizes an investigational study on a ‘novel’ colonoscopy bowel preparation under development by a Massachusetts-based company. The release claims that the prep is a more palatable regimen that includes solid food bars and low-volume beverages. Researchers report that by the end of the Stage 2 clinical trial, the regimen was as safe and effective as two currently available colonoscopy prep formulations in cleaning out the colon, and, importantly, participating trial volunteers gave the preparation a high rating. The release did a good job of describing the study and quantifying benefits. The existing preps that the novel formulation was compared against were never mentioned and that seems an important omission. The release also didn’t provide enough details about harms, or a ballpark cost estimate, which it seems reasonable to expect in almost all news releases. The study was presented at the American College of Gastroenterology’s 2016 annual meeting. The standard bowel preparation and prolonged fasting required to ensure a clean viewing field for the gastroentologist is daunting and has been suggested as a limiting factor in acceptance. For those approaching the magic age,  Dave Barry’s 2009 article in the Miami Herald provides a humorous look at this screening procedure. But the reality is that colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the United States and individuals should have a discussion about the benefits and risks of the procedure. The US Preventive Services Task Force recommends screening for colorectal cancer using fecal occult blood testing, sigmoidoscopy, or colonoscopy in adults, beginning at age 50 years and continuing until age 75 years.

{"claim_id":9983,"claim":"Gastric bypass surgery cuts cancer risk, researchers say","explanation":"This was a story reporting on presentation of data suggesting that an additional benefit that may be gleaned from having weight loss surgery is a reduced cancer risk. It failed to mention that the results reported on were part of an oral presentation and have therefore not been through adequate peer review and should be considered as preliminary. The story did include several quotes from experts in the field tempering the enthusiasm of some of the other quotes. The story devoted a lot of space describing study results about reductions in various cancer incidences that were statistically insignificant. Many readers will not understand the term ‘statistically insignificant’, especially when coupled with statements of relative risk reductions of 50, 60 or 70%. By presenting only relative – not absolute – risk, the story made the differences seems quite large when in reality they might be the difference of only one or two and certainly might be the result of chance rather than an effect of the procedures discussed. (Overall cancer cases were reported but were not broken down by cancer type. So we don’t know what a 70% reduction in pancreatic cancer, for example, really means.)","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9701,"claim":"Marijuana Chemical Shows Promise for Hard-to-Treat Epilepsy in Kids","explanation":"Efficacy and safety studies of a marijuana-derived oil on children for whom existing drugs fail to control epileptic seizures support moving cannabidiol into clinical studies. That’s good news. Less cheery is encountering stories about the effects of this drug before it has been tested in placebo-controlled, blinded research venues — or even before the research has undergone peer review. The story in this case makes the shortcomings of the evidence a prominent point in the coverage and we applaud this careful approach. But whether desperate parents will heed that signal is another matter. A source notes in the story that a “major” clinical trial’s results will become available early in 2016. Might the more responsible path have been for journalism to bide its time as well? When a child suffers, little else matters. Parents of epileptic kids whose seizures are not responsive to anti-seizure medicines will be on the lookout for alternatives. Some have apparently already begun to treat their children with marijuana-derived oils similar to that being examined in these studies. Learning as much as possible—as soon as possible—about these chemicals is, consequently, important.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":11426,"claim":"Today’s Matters of the Heart: Dr. Nancy’s Personal Wake-Up Call","explanation":"This long (almost 6 minutes – very long for TV news) segment was, nonetheless, almost completely devoid of evidence and of data. So it rode the single personal anecdote of the network’s medical editor, her vague complaints of feeling “tired, short of breath, just not feeling like myself”, and her path to getting a CT scan of her coronary arteries. The segment was presented in a manner we deem as disease-mongering, likely to frighten many women into thinking THEY needed such a scan. A line like the following – “The symptoms of heart disease in women can be so subtle, the disease process so quiet, so insidious, that many women don’t get in to see their doctors until it’s too late” – demands some data to back it up. How often is this case? How representative was the medical editor’s story? But without data and without evidence, there were heaps of squishy, unverified claims. The medical editor said, “There’s no doubt that plaque is a result of the cheeseburgers I ate as a teenager.”  No doubt? Sorry, that doesn’t cut it. The segment failed to indicate that the kind of picture provided by the CT angiography may not actually change the course of treatment in cases like the medical editor’s. She earlier explained that she had an elevated cholesterol level, which likely would have been treated with cholesterol lowering medication anyway. So it is unclear how the CT angiography provided her with any benefit. Studies have not consistently shown that imaging test results improve adherence to treatment. There was also no mention of the harms of incidental findings – things the CT finds that only cause worry but don’t help with diagnosis or treatment. All in all, the six minutes could have been used much more wisely. But the networks – NBC in particular (with recent stories about their own Mike Taibbi, George Lewis and now Nancy Snyderman) love to tell their own health sagas – whether or not they include evidence and data that viewers need.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9286,"claim":"Pilot clinical trial finds injected immune cells safe in multiple myeloma patients","explanation":"This is a report of a phase I clinical trial testing whether specific immune cells harvested from the bone marrow, grown in the lab and then re-infused into multiple myeloma patients can effectively change the immune environment in the patient and suggest a possibly improved disease outcome. It looks at using a different population of immune cells — marrow-infiltrating lymphocytes (MILs) — from those used in previous studies. These are both easier to retrieve and easier to grow in the lab, two factors that reduce the complexity of this treatment approach. The release is in many ways a model for other organizations reporting on similar studies. The description of the study is clear, the language used appropriately conservative, and there is context regarding the novelty of the approach and current alternative treatments. Some discussion of possible costs — preliminary though it would have to be — would have completed the picture for readers. Rather than hyping such a study in a frenzied attempt to attract clicks and eyeballs, Hopkins presents the findings in a thoughtful way that reflects well on the institution’s reputation and will help build that reputation over the long haul. Multiple myeloma is one of several cancers of the blood and the National Cancer Institute estimates that nearly 27,000 new cases of myeloma will be diagnosed this year. Less than half of patients live as much as five years after their diagnosis, and more than 11,000 patients are expected to die from the disease this year.

{"claim_id":9329,"claim":"VITAMIN D: SUPPLEMENT LINKED TO WEIGHT LOSS IN OVERWEIGHT AND OBESE CHILDREN","explanation":"Newsweek covers the results of a preliminary study that suggest a weekly dose of vitamin D might help children with obesity. While the story provides important context to the issue, identifies some caveats, and includes the voice of an outside expert, some key details weren’t included. The study did not appear to control for things like daily activity levels (which can positively influence many aspects of health), and it covered a small population size with a limited geographic scope. Childhood obesity is a real problem, as the story points out, and a big one that affects more than 40 million kids under the age of 5 years. Life is short on simple and readily available fixes to major problems, so it makes for a compelling health story when scientific results hint at such a fix. But media outlets must be careful in covering rudimentary results, even if their competitors are doing so with abandon and generating great attention as a result. With this study, the results may or may not pan out after larger, longer, and more detailed studies are completed. And while taking vitamin D supplements on a weekly basis may seem innocuous, there are some risks.

{"claim_id":9191,"claim":"New method reduces adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment","explanation":"This brief news release describes a lengthy randomized trial at Sweden’s prestigious Karolinksa Institutet that compared various treatment regimens for patients with rectal cancer and concluded that delaying surgery after radiation therapy resulted in fewer postoperative complications. The study, published in The Lancet Oncology, also found no difference in outcomes between short-course and long-course radiation therapy prior to surgery. The news release refrains from disease mongering and is forthcoming about the fact that the study springs from a need to address adverse effects associated with radiation therapy. But it’s missing quantified benefits, cost data and a few other details that would help readers grasp the significance of the findings. The American Cancer Society estimates there will be 39,910 new cases of rectal cancer diagnosed in the U.S. this year. Colon and rectal cancer together constitute the second leading cause of cancer-related deaths in the U.S. and the third most common cancer in both men and women. Administering radiation to shrink a tumor before it is removed surgically was found to reduce recurrence and death versus surgery alone, but questions remained about how to pace radiation and how long to wait between radiation and surgery. According to these researchers, delaying surgery by several weeks not only results in fewer complications with no compromise in outcomes, but also gives patients time to adopt healthier lifestyles in preparation for surgery and undergo chemotherapy if there’s a high risk that the cancer will spread.","label":"MISLEADING"}

There is no cure for AMD and once the vision is lost it cannot be regained. However, there is hope that AMD can be prevented or the rate of loss slowed using vitamin supplementation. This story reports on a new study showing  that women who took a specific combination of b-vitamin supplements had a lower risk of developing AMD after 7 years. The story does a good job of describing potential conflicts of interest of the quoted experts, one of whom is not involved in the research or funded by the vitamin manufacturer. The story adequately represents the availability and novelty of the supplements, although it is not clear if this particular combination of vitamins is available and if so, if they are available over the counter or by prescription only. The story quantifies the number of cases of AMD in the vitamin group as well as the control group. The story should have provided a denominator for these numbers so that the reader can get a sense of the size of the risk. The story could have been improved by describing the cost of the vitamins as well as potential harms. While vitamins are generally safe, the FDA does not regulate supplements and therefore there is no guarantee of strength, purity or safety of the product. Furthermore there are some important contraindications and consumers should talk with their doctor before taking the vitamins.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":11493,"claim":"Researchers develop test for pregnancy complication","explanation":"\"This story took preliminary research on a diagnostic test for a common and urgent pregnancy complication—preeclampsia—and made the research appear to be a life-saving medical breakthrough. In the study, an international group of researchers reported identifying a “metabolic signature”—a group of 14 biomarkers in the blood of pregnant women—that might aid in the diagnosis of preeclampsia in its early stages. The diagnostic test, like any complex diagnostic technology, faces years of research development and clinical trials. The article offered a best-case scenario for the development of this test. It did not provide a single cautionary note to balance out this hopeful view. The main question that goes unanswered in this story is whether a diagnostic test that was studied in 120 women and then validated in 79 pregnant women in Australia will be equally valuable for millions of women around the world. Will it turn into a test that can be administered simply and interpreted easily? Could it be just as useful in Mali, Cambodia, or Micronesia as it might be in developed nations? Will the test have adequate predictive value—both positive and negative—in a wide range of ethnic groups and among women with differing health problems? Only time and further research will tell. If this test lives up the diagnostic potential envisioned in the Reuters story, it would be a major step forward indeed. But the story should have provided more independent experts to give a more balanced view of the evidence that supports it. The Reuters article closed with an optimistic quote from Eleni Tsigas, Executive Director of the Preeclampsia Foundation, on the potential of this test to identify women at risk. But perhaps the article should have included another quote from Tsigas that appeared in a Canadian newspaper: “I am not going to be breaking out the champagne yet…” (See Wingrove J, Globe and Mail, September 13, 2010). Preeclampsia is a common but poorly understood pregnancy complication characterized by dangerously high blood pressure and elevated levels of protein in the urine. It affects up to 8% of pregnancies worldwide, with a particularly damaging impact in developing nations. In the United States preeclampsia is the root cause of 18% of maternal deaths. For babies born prematurely because of maternal preeclampsia, it is an important precursor of developmental abnormalities. The identification of a diagnostic test for preeclampsia has been termed the \"\"Holy Grail of obstetrics.\"\" If preeclampsia could be recognized early in pregnancy, it might be possible to ward off some of its potentially serious consequences through vigilant surveillance of mother and baby. And identification of early changes that precede preeclampsia might boost research efforts into finding more effective treatments.\"","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10268,"claim":"Taking aspirin could increase cancer survival by 20 percent","explanation":"Aspirin is one of the most well-studied drugs on the planet, in terms of treating headaches, aches, and pains as well as in helping out those who are at risk of heart disease — the biggest killer of people in developed nations. This release promotes a study that looks at the common drug’s effect on the second-biggest killer, which is cancer. The meta-analysis crunched the data of five randomized trials and 42 smaller studies that focused on colorectal, prostate, and breast cancers and — most importantly — the effect of a low-dose aspirin regimen on the survival of those patients, as well as how their cancer spread over a period of about 5 years. The correlation is eyebrow-raising, with a reduction in death and cancer spread in the neighborhood of about 20%. On the downside, this release doesn’t really get into what might be causing this reduction, or even define what “low-dose aspirin” means. It also doesn’t adequately discuss the risks (e.g. bleeding, allergies, and stomach ulcers) and skips over a couple of other basics that would have been helpful to journalists and readers alike. Behind heart disease, cancer is the biggest killer of people in developed nations. Each year the disease kills about 176 in every 100,000 people in the UK, and roughly 171 in every 100,000 people in the US. Any treatment that that can improve survival — especially low-cost, non-invasive methods — deserves attention. Aspirin is one of the best-studied drugs on the planet, and its risks and side effects are as well known as a preventative treatment for people who are at risk of heart disease, or who’ve had strokes or heart attacks before. Aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) have been studied for use in the prevention of cancer. The best data exists for low-dose aspirin and colorectal cancer prevention. The US Preventative Task Force released a final recommendation in April 2016 suggesting certain adults (ages 50-59) might reduce their risk of developing both colorectal cancer and cardiovascular disease if they undertake long-term use (10 years) of low-dose aspirin. The current study examines whether aspirin could improve survival among patients who already have cancer. The authors suggest benefit but admit that the data is limited and mainly comes from observational studies.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":10431,"claim":"Study: Many elderly get colon screening too often","explanation":"As the WSJ blog did, this story’s interview quotes provided important perspectives:  Researcher Goodwin saying “I was surprised by the magnitude of the issue.”   “Robert Smith, director of cancer screening at the American Cancer Society, said some doctors may recommend more frequent colonoscopies because they think 10-year intervals are too risky. Some may think, incorrectly, that finding any growths, even non-suspicious polyps, means a repeat exam should be done within less than 10 years, Smith said. Some doctors also order repeat tests “because they want to bring in income,” he said. Besides being risky and costly, too-frequent screenings make colonoscopy resources less available for people who really need them, Smith said. This was a well done story about a very well done study with important practice and policy implications.","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":10834,"claim":"Researchers at Philadelphia conference announce progress toward noninvasive colon cancer test","explanation":"The story suffers from a lack of independent voices and a lack of clear analysis of the data. There was little more than a nod to the potential harms done in over-screening. Detection of a marker for a disease is not the same as preventing a disease or preventing a death. The story says that “very few people avail themselves of [screening] colonoscopy – only about 20 percent.” That was one researcher’s estimate – someone with a vested financial interest in this research. But the fact is that the CDC BRFSS survey estimates that about 60% of US adults are up to date with screening, most with colonoscopy. That is a big difference from 20%, and one has to wonder why that was not double-checked. Still, there clearly are a lot of people being missed. How to improve those numbers is up for debate. Stories about new types of screening need to make clear comparisons between the success rates of colonoscopies now and the possible success rates of these emerging technologies.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":9671,"claim":"Smart air quality device and app helps you breathe easier","explanation":"The story describes a device and related mobile app, called Awair, that monitors air quality in the home and reports the information to users. The story offers little information about how the device could actually benefit users. More importantly, the story makes the air in our homes sound positively terrifying, using language that seems aimed at making homeowners scared of everything from dust to dirty carpets. The lack of quantified benefits — or any information about how accurate the device is — make this story read more like a paid promotion than a news article. Journalism is more than simply reciting facts. Reporters should ask questions, talk to independent sources, and help readers understand why (or if) something might be important to them. Reporters need to be skeptical critical thinkers, filtering through a sea of information before passing information on to readers in a context that helps the reader understand what’s going on. This story offers readers vague, scary information and points to a specific commercial product as a solution to a problem that readers may not know they had (if they have it at all). Some of the things mentioned in the story, like carbon monoxide poisoning, are legitimate concerns — but the story fails to mention options like carbon monoxide detectors, which would be less expensive options than the tech that the story does focus on. In short, consumers need sources of news that can offer reliable, thoughtful insight into health issues — not news stories that scare readers without offering context or detail.","label":"false"}

The number of waivers are a small sample of all health plans, and many more waivers were given to big companies and corporations. We looked for additional information or evidence on this point and didn’t find it. But there are additional problems with the ad. The ad doesn’t mention that the waivers only apply to annual coverage limits, that they’re intended to be in place only until 2014 and that many for-profit companies have received the same waivers. It gives the impression that unions are entirely exempt from the health care law, which they are not.

There was no warning or disclaimer as to the origin of the text. Accordingly, we’ve downgraded the score from 4 stars to 0, to reflect the fact that this wasn’t a piece of original journalism. Read this related blog post for further explanation. This very thorough analysis of a newly published study of an experimental vaccine had much to admire, including clear quantification of benefits and an acknowledgment of study dropouts and potential harms. It could have been improved by two things: an independent source or two providing their take on the publication and some information about what the vaccine might ultimately cost patients and insurers. The development of a vaccine to prevent human papilloma virus (HPV) infection was a big advance in efforts to prevent cervical cancer. This study shows that a similar experimental vaccine can be of benefit to women who’ve already been infected with HPV and whose cervixes show evidence of precancerous changes. According to the study, the new vaccine can boost the body’s natural immune response and cause high-grade precancerous changes in the cervix to regress. It can also help clear the virus from the cervix, reducing the risk of future cancers. The current treatments for precancerous changes all involve some form of invasive procedure with tissue destruction in the cervix, which can compromise future childbearing ability. Thus the vaccine may offer a significant advantage over currently available treatments.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":11303,"claim":"Peanuts, peanut butter may hold key to preventing obesity","explanation":"Carrying a misleading headline, and some not-quite-accurate and confusing descriptions of the study, this news release describes research designed to evaluate the impact on overweight or obese teens of complying with a healthier snacking regimen — one involving peanuts and peanut butter. It could have been markedly strengthened by less emphasis on quotes stating the obvious and questionable (“…unhealthy eating  habit(s) can lead to an unhealthy weight”; “snacking is more common during the adolescent years”), and more emphasis on the design, context and hopeful outcome of this small, but rigorous randomized controlled intervention trial. Families, students, schools, and public health specialists are in a frustrating battle to prevent and address obesity and its damaging consequences. As this release notes, this may be especially true in poor, urban and minority children and teens whose diets are more likely to be composed of fast food meals, and sugary, greasy, nutritionally deficient snacks after school. Widely publicized efforts — like New York City’s ban on large-sized soda pop sales — to introduce teens (and adults) to healthier diets, haven’t seemed to do much to increase desire for carrot sticks, fruit, and yogurt in these populations. So any study that suggests a) it really is possible to get teens to try, and to stick with a nutrient-rich snack like peanuts instead of unhealthy snacks; b) that providing such snacks may reduce body mass index despite the peanut’s high energy content; and c) a snack may find favor with adolescents’ famously picky food preferences, is bound to get attention, even if the good results are modest and the trial relatively small.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9242,"claim":"Cocoa compound linked to some cardiovascular biomarker improvements","explanation":"There have been so many stories about the possible health benefits of cocoa flavanol-derived chocolate over the years and so many studies purporting to document these benefits that it is useful to have a meta-analysis of the available clinical trial evidence. This release is based on a review of 19 randomized controlled trials that studied the effects of cocoa flavanols on biomarkers of heart health. We expected to see a lot of good data in this release but found very little. Instead we found strong statements about the findings being “significant” or about how the “benefits they were evident for both women and men.” There were a few caveats sprinkled in too, helpfully. The study authors are quoted saying the review and meta-analysis point to the need for larger, longer clinical trials to judge whether these changes in biomarkers translate into actual improved outcomes for people. And there was an acknowledgment that some of the funding for the work came from one of the world’s biggest chocolate makers. What’s the harm with another story or another news release about chocolate, or cocoa flavanols? There isn’t any — if the information is balanced and complete. The problem with so much of the information about chocolate is that it’s usually imbalanced and incomplete, superficially shallow, and treating chocolate as a no-brainer superfood.

{"claim_id":9110,"claim":"Resistance training may slow down the progression of multiple sclerosis","explanation":"This news release from Aarhus University in Denmark claims that resistance training twice a week could protect the nervous system by minimizing brain shrinkage in multiple sclerosis (MS) patients, but offers no numbers backing the claims. The release summarizes a study published in the Multiple Sclerosis Journal on the protective effects of resistance training. It emphasizes to readers that resistance training should not replace medication, but instead supplement it. It also provides a study limitation — something not all news releases do. The release notes that it’s unclear whether the training could benefit all MS patients since this “has not been sufficiently tested in more severely affected patients.” The lead author further notes that he is not “recommending that all multiple sclerosis patients throw themselves into intensive physical training regimes without first seeking professional advice.” We applaud the inclusion of this information. However, the main thing missing in this release is context. No numbers are given to back up its benefit claims. How much brain shrinkage was seen in patients undergoing resistance training compared to those who weren’t? And how much brain growth did researchers see in response to resistance training? Finally, does a change in cortical thickness translate to improvements in quality of life or cognitive abilities? Although thicker layers on a brain scan sounds good, it is how well a person feels and functions and how long they live that is more important. MS is the most common disabling neurologic disease of young people and affects approximately 400,000 people in the United States and 2.5 million worldwide. The disease can cause mild symptoms or be profoundly tragic. About half of people with MS experience cognitive impairments, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke. Patients with severe progressive MS often become wheelchair bound and suffer from dementia as their brains shrink over time. They become dependent on others and may end up in a nursing home if strong family support is not available. There is no cure for MS. Most treatments are centered around managing symptoms, quality of life and assistive technology to help cope with disability. If there is a cost-effective, low-risk alternative for slowing MS progression, this would certainly be newsworthy for the public, especially if it is supported by medical evidence.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9059,"claim":"Type 2 diabetes is not for life","explanation":"The news release focuses on a Lancet article describing the first-year results of an ongoing two-year study aimed at determining how effective diet-based weight loss can be at achieving remission of type 2 diabetes in adults. The release notes that 45.6 percent of patients who took part in the weight loss program achieved remission of their type 2 diabetes, and that remission was closely correlated with weight loss; the more weight study participants lost, the more likely they were to achieve remission. While the release does a good job of describing the study, it does not mention previous studies related to weight loss and type 2 diabetes. That’s a significant oversight that makes it difficult for readers to place the new findings in context. It’s worth noting that HealthNewsReview.org reviewed a previous release from the same university on earlier findings from the same research group. While the more recent release does a better job of addressing benefits and the quality of the evidence, some problems — such as the failure to address novelty and place the work in context — were not addressed. Further, there is no mention in the release about the conflicts of interest on the part of several authors in their relationships with Counterweight and Cambridge Weight Plans. And like the TIME story on the Newcastle University research, the release doesn’t inform readers about cost and harms of the diet. Type 2 diabetes is a common medical problem. According to the CDC, an estimated 30.3 million Americans have diabetes — and approximately 95 percent of them have type 2 diabetes. And the incidence of type 2 diabetes appears to be on the rise. That means research findings about new treatment options for type 2 diabetes have a large audience. It’s important for related news releases to place these new research findings into context. How do they build on or differ from previous studies? What could that mean for treatment options? These are important considerations for those living with type 2 diabetes, and the release falls short on these points.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9655,"claim":"Many women could benefit from earlier mammograms, analysis finds","explanation":"This story summarizes an as-yet-unpublished research study that performed risk assessments for breast cancer among women age 40 to 44 visiting a specialty breast clinic. Of the 900 women whose risks were assessed, about 50 percent had an above-average risk for breast cancer, the analysis found. The study did not examine if these women went on to develop breast cancer, only whether they had risk factors that challenged the common notion to wait until 45 for screening, something that should have been better emphasized in the story. The story didn’t discuss the limitations of risk assessments, nor explain or define what “risk” really means. The headline also overstated the scope of the study. These issues–paired with a lack of information on costs and screening harms–add up to an incomplete story. Understanding a person’s risk for cancer is beneficial and can help doctors and patients make informed decisions about screenings and care.

{"claim_id":9330,"claim":"Antidepressants, psychotherapy may help ease irritable bowel syndrome","explanation":"The story focuses on a recently published journal article that evaluates the available research on whether antidepressants or psychotherapy may reduce the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS). The article does a good job of addressing the limitations of the research and incorporating input from independent experts. However, the story fumbled a bit when explaining the results of the meta-analysis, and didn’t discuss costs or harms of treatments. According to the CDC, IBS affects more than 1 percent of the U.S. adult population. And those living with IBS can often suffer from a reduced quality of life. In other words, a great many people are very interested in news about therapeutic options for addressing their condition. While we think the story does a good job of stressing that antidepressants and psychotherapy don’t constitute a “silver bullet” for addressing IBS, we think it’s important to highlight that one of these options (antidepressants) carries risks of its own. And both options can carry significant costs.","label":"MISLEADING"}

The commentary, published in the journal Nature, raises a topic that’s significant to people as individuals and to society as a whole. While clearly biased in favor of wider use of the drugs, the commentary clearly meets the test of \"\"reportability\"\" in mainstream media. The news report does a credible job of summarizing the authors’ main points and gathering independent assessment to put it in context. It included an important balancing perspective from a bioethicist, who said:  \"\"It’s a nice puff piece for selling medications for people who don’t have an illness of any kind.\"\" The report’s most significant shortcoming is that it never made clear that there is no good data to support the assumption that the drugs improve cognitive outcomes. As the ratings below show, the report would have been better if it had mentioned costs more explicitly, and put the issue in the context of other methods people can and do use to enhance brain function. The article does a reasonable job in covering the major points made in the commentary. Unfortunately almost 20% of the article is devoted to specific information about the drugs rather than the myriad of issues raised by the commentary.

{"claim_id":9559,"claim":"How to heal head injuries? Try new app","explanation":"This story describes a pilot study that used an app to track cognitive and physical activity in 34 young concussion patients during the two weeks after their injuries. The study, summarized in a letter in JAMA Pediatrics, was designed by researchers at the University of Pennsylvania and the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia to test the feasibility of gathering real-time data from objective measures. The story contains some original reporting but misleads readers when it takes its lead from the news release and asserts that the observational findings “suggest that the right balance during recovering from concussion may be resting one’s brain but still getting some physical activity.” In reality, the main conclusion of the study was simply that the app can be a useful tool for tracking activity following a concussion. This misleading notion is reinforced by the headline, “How to heal head injuries? Try a new app.” It’s not available for trying, and it’s not intended to heal head injuries. A more accurate headline would be “Researchers determine app may be reliable way to track activity and symptoms after a concussion, pending further research.”   Concussion was diagnosed in about 1.5 percent of 11- to 19-year-olds in 2015, the highest rate of any age group, according to a Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association report. Since teens and smart phones are pretty much inseparable, an app could be a useful tool for researchers to track symptoms and compliance around activity. Whether a symptom\/activity tracking app could have any impact on permanent cognitive damage remains unknown, and news stories need to be clear about that.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9963,"claim":"Robot prostate surgery has downsides, needs more data","explanation":"This is a story about a study examining the costs, harms and the impact of doctor experience associated with the use of robotic prostatectomy. The story raised some important issues that are not ordinarily broached during patient – doctor conversations. While raising some potential red flags with respect to doctor experience, the story failed to critically examine what, if any, benefit there might be to this particular surgical approach. While it is valuable to know that after completing 80 procedures of this type, a surgeon is no longer apt to leave cancerous tissue behind, it is also important to know if there is any value added by having this more expensive procedure. The story does serve as an important reminder to consumers that more modern sounding approaches do not necessarily offer the patient a less problem plagued experience. This story is provides an example for consumers to consider about the value in knowing about both the benefits as well as the harms associated with whatever treatment option they are considering. Further – the story raises the point that newer or seemingly more sophisticated treatments are not always superior to lower-tech options.","label":"true"}

CT\/PET is an improvement on CT, MRI, or X-ray because it can differentiate cancer cells from normal cells based on glucose metabolism. Accurate staging is important because invasive surgery is as stake. Although this story accurately represents the novelty and availability of the technology, avoids disease mongering and quotes multiple sources, it does not provide the reader with enough information on alternative options, the nature of the clinical evidence, the harms\/side effects of the test, or the costs.

{"claim_id":10737,"claim":"Good energy for bad: Reiki, a Japanese practice of clearing away negative energy, is finding acceptance in U.S. medicine","explanation":"Reiki, the Japanese practice of “energy healing” is one of many complementary or alternative medical services now available at select health centers in the U.S. This story describes the use of Reiki therapy for several diseases and conditions. Although the story attempts to describe the evidence to support reiki therapy, ultimately it fails to provide the reader with balanced information on what reiki can or can’t do. Although the story describes the benefits of treatment in two studies, the story fails to provide adequate information on the nature of the benefits. For example, the story states that “more than 75% reported increased energy” and “those receiving Reiki took fewer pain medications.” Neither statement provides adequate information on the benefits. How much energy? How many fewer medications? Also, because the story does not explain the design of these studies, the reader does not know how much of this benefit may be due to placebo effect. The story didn’t discuss the limitations of small studies (22 patients in one) or of studies that rely on patients’ self-reporting of improvement. Although the story mentions several trials, the reader is not provided with enough information to evaluate the strength of the available evidence. How were the studies designed? What were the outcomes measured? How long was the follow up? The story mentions that Reiki is available at a handful of institutions, but this is insufficient information on availability. How many Reiki practitioners are there around the country, and in what types of settings? Are they licensed or certified? If so, by whom? If not, what does that mean? A major concern with many alternative practices is that providers have minimal training yet still are paid quite a sum of money to “practice” their art, regardless of whether it is proven effective.","label":"MISLEADING"}

Instead, a judge would decide whether to register for life those convicted of having voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor and are within 10 years of age of the victim. The bill does not reduce the standards for statutory rape. Existing law allows judges to decide whether to place offenders on the registry in cases involving vaginal intercourse.

{"claim_id":10170,"claim":"Less acid, brittler hips? Some heartburn drugs may be behind an increase in fractures","explanation":"This is a compact (only 566 words), nicely reported story that places a potentially important development in its appropriate context. The researchers went to great lengths in their published study to weed out variables other than heartburn drugs that might explain the increase in hip fractures that they observed. Nevertheless, they acknowledge that their retrospective review of a large patient database is inherently incapable of proving cause and effect. The quote from Dr. Alan Buchman in the news story summarizes this chief drawback well: The patients, he notes, may “have some other problem that increases the risk of fractures.” The study provides reasonable evidence to support the news article’s recommendations that patients should only use the drugs if they need them, and even then take them only at their lowest beneficial dose. Whether “the solution is to simply consume more calcium” remains unknown, unfortunately. Additional advice on the benefits of lifestyle and dietary changes would have been welcome, and perhaps a note on the relatively lower fracture risk associated with the class known as histamine blockers. In the end, the take home point may be that patients and doctors should periodically question the need to take any medicine used over the long term, even ones thought to be very safe.","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":9149,"claim":"New Peer-Reviewed Clinical Study Successfully Validates The Use Of Proove Opioid Risk® To Predict Prescription Opioid Abuse","explanation":"This news release from Proove Biosciences Inc. reports on a test designed to identify those at risk of becoming addicted to opioids so doctors can improve their prescribing practices. The release summarizes a study showing that the company’s algorithm, which combines genetic markers with lifestyle and behavior variables, accurately distinguishes between healthy patients with no history of opioid abuse and patients receiving opioid addiction treatment. The study, however, may be comparing people with opioid use disorder with the wrong control group, given that a more useful distinction would be between those who have become addicted and those who have used opioids in similar circumstances without becoming addicted. In addition, the news release fails to provide information about the study’s funding source, nor does it note that four of the study’s six authors work for Proove. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), opioid overdose killed more than 33,000 Americans in 2015. Almost half of those who died were using a prescription opioid, although not necessarily one that had been prescribed to them. Many of those who become addicted to prescription opioids or heroin develop those addictions after being prescribed opioid painkillers. Reducing the number of deaths caused by opioid abuse has emerged as a national health priority, although policy-makers have not been able to address how to go about it — much less fund an opioid abuse reduction program. An inexpensive and reliable test that could accurately predict one’s risk of becoming addicted to opioids could be a welcome development. However, this tool and others like it have been criticized for both reliability and questionable marketing practices.","label":"false"}

Acknowledged in the release as “controversial” and in direct opposition to the recommendations of the American Psychiatric Association, the use of ketamine can improve depression symptoms with six infusions or less, according to the release. The news release is thin on the kinds of facts we look for to support assertions about a drug’s safety and efficacy. It doesn’t address cost, benefit data or harms. It touts the putative benefits of a treatment that has not been approved by federal health authorities as either safe or effective, and it offers little evidence to support its use. It makes no mention of randomized trials in terms of real data–the only way one can tell if a treatment is really of benefit. Depression affects some 350 million people globally, according to the World Health Organization, and represents the leading cause of disability. Although effective treatments exist for depression, they do not always work. A new weapon in the armamentarium of health professionals might reduce the impact of depression, which can lead to suicide. Standard anti-depressant medication and therapy generally take a month or more to help, and it would be great to have something with a quicker onset on action as ketamine purportedly has.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9479,"claim":"Finding the Right Medication: Gene Test May Help Treat Depression","explanation":"This NBC story uses the narrative of a woman who struggled to find an effective medication to treat her severe depression to talk about the potential benefits of using genetic testing to identify which drugs may be most effective in treating depression, with the fewest side effects, for specific patients. Unfortunately, it lacks discussion of any rigorous research supporting the clinical utility of such genetic testing, the potential harms patients might experience as a result of genetic testing, or how the specific genetic test discussed in the story differs from others currently in use. As the story notes, the Centers for Disease Control report that about one of every 20 Americans 12 and older cope with depression and some of them (not “many more,” as the story claims) experience severe side effects from the drugs used to treat depression. Finding the correct drug and the correct dosage for a specific patient can require a sometimes extended process of trial-and-error, with depression sufferers sometimes enduring multiple trials of different drugs before they find one that is effective and has an acceptably low level of negative side effects. Thus, a test or tests that would effectively enable doctors to determine ahead of time which patients are likely to respond well or poorly to specific types of drugs would offer substantial benefits.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9187,"claim":"Scientifically-designed fasting diet lowers risks for major diseases","explanation":"This is a news release marked by extravagant claims but a surprising lack of numerical data to back up those claims. It did not score well on our 10 systematic review criteria. It’s about a small study of 100 people that looked at what happened if they consumed a low-calorie (between 750 to 1,100 calories per day) pre-packaged diet kit for 5 days intermittently over 6 months. The news release suggests that this regimen might lower the patients’ risks of “cancer, diabetes, heart disease and other age-related diseases.” While the release says at the top that the trial “demonstrated a host of benefits” and later “that the diet is feasible, effective and safe for humans,” it says in the next line that larger studies are needed to confirm its effects. So which is it? Did it demonstrate effectiveness? Or is that an effect that needs to be confirmed? The words matter, and can be misleading. The news release alternated between caution and lack of discretion in describing the actual known outcomes of the diet. A study author is quoted saying the study did not prove a lowering of risk, but the news release ignores that warning and claims a risk-lowering was “demonstrated” by this early study. One positive note: The release is to be commended for being transparent about potential conflicts of interest. Being precise in news releases matters because precision or the lack of it affects what the public learns about health and diet strategies. This news release suggests a proprietary pre-packaged diet lowered risk of a wide range of serious diseases, but the study carefully states it proved only “safety” in a very small group of people. This is just the sort of exaggeration that reduces public trust in reports about health and diet, by over-promising and mistaking the measurement of certain endpoints, such as blood pressure or blood biomarkers, with a larger concept such as reducing risk of disease in the long-term. HealthNewsReview.org has seen this pattern repeated so often we have added a page in our toolkit about referencing surrogate endpoints instead of actual health outcomes. For example, an intervention may affect a person’s blood pressure, but that doesn’t mean it decreases their risk of heart disease. It takes much larger and longer studies than the one described in the news release to reach the proof of effectiveness that matters most.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10495,"claim":"One antidepressant shown to control weight during 2-year study","explanation":"This news release describes results of a retrospective study by Group Health on the link between antidepressant drugs and weight change over a two-year period in adults with already-diagnosed depression. The results of the study suggest that compared to a “reference” drug, fluoxetine (best known as Prozac), an SSRI or selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor, only bupropion (marketed as Wellbutrin), an NDRI (norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor) was associated with modest long-term weight loss and only in non-smokers. The news release doesn’t give us any details on costs or side effects associated with the drugs nor does it tell us how the data was measured or analyzed. It also doesn’t include several limitations of the research included in the published study. [Editor’s note: Dr. Arterburn, the lead study investigator quoted in the news release, is a former reviewer and contributor to HealthNewsReview.org.] Depression takes a significant toll on human health, well-being and productivity. It’s a challenging condition to treat, costs billions every year worldwide, and suicide is a too-frequent outcome. Antidepressants are among the mostly commonly prescribed (and heavily marketed) drugs available, and a vast literature about their use suggests there is no particularly significant difference in their effectiveness. All carry some side effects as well. Because many SSRIs have long been linked to weight gain, for obese depressed patients, trying buproprion first might make good sense. Average monthly costs vary widely depending on the availability of generics and doses, and in most cases costs are comparable and covered by insurance, so “differentiators” such as weight issues are not insignificant.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":11169,"claim":"Clinical Trial Demonstrates Success of Low FODMAP Diet","explanation":"This news release touts results from a single-blind randomized controlled trial of a diet that’s emerged in the last decade to relieve symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a tough-to-treat gut disorder with no cure. The low FODMAP (an acronym for Fermentable Oligosaccharides, Disaccharides, Monosaccharides And Polyols) diet eliminates foods that contain large amounts of short-chain carbohydrates that are poorly absorbed in the small intestine. In IBS patients those carbohydrates are believed to feed bacteria in the colon, generating gases that lead to bloating, abdominal discomfort, and changes in bowel function. The low-FODMAP diet restricts an array of foods including honey, high fructose corn syrup, high-fructose fruits such as apples, dairy, wheat, garlic, onion, legumes and beans, some artificial sweeteners, and stone fruits such as avocado and peaches. In the University of Michigan study, registered dietitians educated and monitored 83 patients assigned to either a low FODMAP diet or a healthy control diet in which FODMAPs were not excluded. The trial concluded that after four weeks, the low FODMAP diet improved quality of life, ability to perform activities, and sleep quality compared to the control diet. While the news release rightly encourages patients to consider dietary changes that could improve their symptoms, it would have been more helpful to readers if it included some cautions about the study’s limitations, potential cost of working with an advising dietitian, and the drawbacks of following such a restrictive diet. IBS is a chronic illness that affects an estimated 5 to 15 percent of the developed world but historically has been understudied and undertreated. Symptoms can have a profound effect on sleep, personal relationships, travel, diet, and sexual function, and impose both direct medical costs and indirect costs such as absenteeism from work and school along with decreased quality of life, according to a report in the Journal of Managed Care Pharmacy. The report set the annual cost of IBS treatment in the U.S. at between $1.7 billion and $10 billion in direct medical costs (excluding prescription and over-the-counter drug costs) and $20 billion for indirect costs. There’s no diagnostic test for IBS, and in the past patients were often told their symptoms were the result of a mental disorder. The last decade has seen a surge in efforts to develop effective treatments, but new drugs have met with limited success and tend to be expensive. The low FODMAP diet was originally developed by a research team at Monash University in Melbourne, Australia, where researchers measured the FODMAP content of foods, creating a database and smartphone apps to help patients track intake. Studies have shown that a low FODMAP diet improves symptoms for a majority of IBS patients, but the diet is demanding because it rules out many common foods. It’s often used as a temporary elimination plan; after several weeks, when symptoms disappear, foods are reintroduced slowly over the course of months to help patients determine which specific foods trigger their symptoms. Rigorous study findings that support the efficacy of the low FODMAP diet in the U.S. could prompt more clinicians and patients to embrace it.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":11431,"claim":"Fat Hormone May Trick the Body to Help It Keep Extra Pounds Off","explanation":"This piece reported that use of twice daily injections of a synthesized version of the hormone leptin helped maintain weight loss in a small group of individuals who lost 10% of their body weight in the preceding 5-10 weeks by following a very low-calorie diet. There was no comparison group of people who did not receive the twice-daily injections fed a comparable number of calories following weight loss. No context was given, providing no mention of any other weight loss maintenance methods. The conclusion that this study (of an injected hormone) “suggests that the weight loss solution may eventually be a pill” is totally unsupported by anything in the original research. And it conflicts with a line that appeared just three sentences earlier in the story, which explained, “the lead investigator said the 10-week study was too short and too small to determine whether continuous leptin treatments could allow dieters to keep off their weight permanently and effortlessly.” Finally, the story did not reveal that in the study, subjects were fed a meager 800 calories a day, which is more akin to starvation than to dieting. So it makes the conclusion of the story even less relevant to dieters trying to keep weight off, which was the way the story was framed.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10357,"claim":"Bone drug staves off breast cancer","explanation":"Though tamoxifen and raloxifene were found to have similar efficacy in terms of reducing the incidence of invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women at increased risk of breast cancer, the article failed to distinguish between differences in side effects that were and were not statistically significant (i.e. that there were 36% fewer uterine cancers and 29% fewer blood clots among women who took raloxifene were not statistically significant while the 21% fewer cataracts were statistically significant). The supposed benefit of raloxifene over tamoxifen is about the prevalence of side effects and so this distinction is important. This is issue is then compounded by the quote from the surgical oncologist “Obviously, if a woman says she’s had a deep vein thrombosis before, I wouldn’t hesitate to recommend the other” because it is clear that this is not an evidenced-based statement. It’s fine to include that comment, but important to put it in context of the evidence. In addition, the two drugs were reported by the NCI as producing the same level of impact on quality of life, so the distinction between these two drugs is even less clear.Though this article portrayed raloxifene as the option with enhanced benefit, the results of the study were much less clear cut.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9057,"claim":"Soy, cruciferous vegetables associated with fewer common breast cancer treatment side effects – Georgetown University Medical Center","explanation":"This news release rather thinly describes a study designed to demonstrate whether chemicals naturally found in soy-based foods and cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and kale are linked to reduced side effects of hormone-related treatments among breast cancer survivors. Although the release ably describes some of the reasons the dietary intervention might work and how, it offers no numbers or measurements to support the conclusion that these foods are associated with fewer menopausal symptoms such as fatigue and hot flashes. Nor does it describe how dietary data were collected, and thus how reliable they are. While it aptly cautions breast cancer patients not to start a soy-rich diet until further research is done, it doesn’t say why caution is recommend. Nor does it describe just how much of these foods might be considered beneficial or harmful in a normal diet. So-called “chemoprotective” or “chemopreventive” components such as sulforaphanes found in broccoli sprouts and in soy products have for decades been the subject of studies designed to link them to lower prostate and other cancer rates and to other health benefits. If in fact dietary interventions can be shown to reduce common side effects of breast cancer treatments — particularly those that affect estrogen — women might be more interested in long-term therapies that suppress female hormones, and also greatly improve the quality of their lives. Thus, studies like this one are likely to make news, but readers need information that offers context, and the potential downsides as well as upsides.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9970,"claim":"Exercise reduces heart disease risk in depressed patients","explanation":"This American Academy of Cardiology news release follows a well-trodden path in health news of promoting the benefits of regular exercise. We’re not complaining about yet another article telling us exercise is good. But that’s besides the point because, in fact, the news release fails to grasp that the study is observational in nature, rendering the title of the document — “Exercise reduces heart disease risk in depressed patients” — unsubstantiated. The study is much more cautious about drawing any conclusions from this non-randomized research but you won’t find any of those cautions in the release. The takeaway message of the study is not so much that “exercise is good for you.” Rather, the study seeks to establish whether physical exercise modifies the link between depression and cardiovascular risk. Cardiovascular complications are often observed in people with depressive disorders. The observational study behind this news release seems to suggest that physical exercise could be used to improve cardiovascular risk stratification. The researchers also seemed to be trying to determine the mechanism by which exercise or the lack of it impacts risk factors for cardiovascular disease such as inflammation, oxidative stress and arterial stiffness. The more we understand about connections between depression, exercise and heart disease the better. To what degree do depression and exercise alone or together impact heart health? The study — but not the release — offers some insight into understanding the relationship but doesn’t claim any definitive conclusions. A depressed person reading the release might find it counter-intuitive to say they may reduce their risk for developing cardiovascular disease by taking up exercise. Often, a key symptom of mild or major depression is fatigue and the inability to fully engage in activities, even if they know, as most do, that “exercise is good for them.”","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9154,"claim":"Common cold duration is shortened similarly by zinc acetate and zinc gluconate lozenges","explanation":"This news release describes results of a meta-analysis of seven studies on the use of zinc lozenges for shortening the duration of common colds. The study compared the effectiveness of two kinds of zinc salt in lozenges: zinc acetate and zinc gluconate. Although the studies with zinc acetate lozenges shortened colds more than those with zinc gluconate lozenges, the difference wasn’t large enough to be statistically significant. Researchers also compared the effectiveness of various doses of zinc in the lozenges and found that five trials that used low doses of 85 to 92 mg per day were just as effective as trials that used 192 to 207 mg per day. The conclusion of the study was that zinc lozenges do shorten the length of the common cold, but more studies are needed to confirm optimal ingredients of lozenges and the ideal dosage. The news release is meticulous about accuracy in reporting the study findings, but doesn’t provide any information about when zinc should be taken, the actual benefit in terms of days shaved off from suffering cold symptoms, and alternatives and disadvantages of using zinc to treat the common cold. Zinc lozenges as a means of treatment for the common cold have begun to get widespread public attention in the past three to five years. With colds being an issue that touches many people at least once a year, it is useful for the general public to have information about what type of zinc lozenge could be most effective.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10795,"claim":"Researchers one step closer to potential autism test","explanation":"Both stories relied on journalism tropes. In the Reuters story, researchers were “closing in on an accurate test for autism.” Here they are “finding more pieces of the autism puzzle of with the help of MRI scans”. The latter is more accurate. If you now have three pieces of a 500-piece puzzle, you still have more pieces than you did before. The story follows through with this more cautious lead by presenting a better — if not complete — analysis of the evidence and using independent sources to bring some much needed perspective on the findings. Unfortunately, like the Reuters story, this one gave readers no solid quantification of harms or benefits, and no cost information. The currently available specific testing methods for the diagnosis of autism and autism spectrum disorders are blunt instruments. While more accurate than routinely used tools, the current autism diagnostic tools are not as sensitive and specific as needed. That is why a good diagnostic tool would be a welcome addition. It remains to be seen however if the promise of diffusion tensor MRI screening will be realized. To be useful, a diagnostic test for autism should have a high degree of sensitivity especially in young children. Identifying children at risk early is essential if any intervention is to work in reducing the impact of the disorder. Screening for autism early and making decisions based on that screening can have very real consequences. In the absence of proven clinical treatments for autism, parents spend whatever they can on natural remedies, specific diets and behavioral therapies. In the absence of real proof, journalists need to make sure any evidence they help to promote has been properly vetted.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10190,"claim":"Heart CT Scans Outperform Stress Tests in Spotting Clogged Arteries","explanation":"This release from Johns Hopkins describes results from a head-to-head comparison study that found computed tomography (CT) scans of the heart’s vessels outperformed single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) stress tests in detecting clogged arteries. The analysis came from a trial that compared how well the two noninvasive imaging techniques (CT scans and SPECT stress tests) matched up with invasive coronary angiography. A quick read of this news release could erroneously lead readers to believe the current standard initial imaging test for a blocked heart artery, SPECT stress testing, should be immediately tossed aside in favor of CT angiography, and that the switch would improve heart attack prevention. While the release had several strengths, it inflated the benefits and soft-pedaled study limitations. Our reviewers suggest the findings are of modest importance because while identifying blocked arteries is important, the bigger question is: What is the prognosis (what will happen to me if I don’t do anything differently?) and how should patients be treated? Identifying blocked vessels is part of that, but it doesn’t provide a complete picture. The release doesn’t mention that elements of the standard stress test, unlike the CT scan, can help predict prognosis. The release presumes that finding blocked arteries is the goal when really what patients and providers need to know is whether or not to undergo additional interventions. About 15 million Americans seek medical attention each year for chest pain, shortness of breath and extreme fatigue — symptoms that may signal a clogged artery. A study that definitively showed that one non-invasive imaging test outperformed another in accurately detecting clogged arteries would be of wide interest. However, one study rarely changes clinical practice. And even when results clearly indicate a newer test does a better job of measuring what it measures, that doesn’t necessarily mean it will automatically improve the health of patients. News releases shouldn’t confuse advancing the ball with scoring a touchdown.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9268,"claim":"Study paves way for steroid treatments with fewer side effects","explanation":"Adrenal gland disorders such as congenital adrenal hyperplasia are controlled by steroid treatments, usually cortisol, which can lead to weight gain, high blood pressure and diabetes. Researchers here are testing another of the body’s steroids, corticosterone, and find in basic studies that it may avoid some of those symptoms. This release does a nice job of explaining the outcomes of these studies and comparing them to typical outcomes of cortisol use. But it is less adept at reminding readers that the research to date is far shy of the clinical studies needed to determine the efficacy of this new treatment. We all want to avoid treatments that may fix one problem but produce others. The effort to come up with a safer steroid replacement for cortisol is worthwhile, if early in the game. Identifying possible new treatments that reduce or eliminate debilitating drug side effects is a laudable goal and worthy of news coverage. But it is important to keep in mind that the road from promising early results in an animal model or in a small number of patients for a brief period of time is a difficult one.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9182,"claim":"Exact Sciences and Mayo Clinic study shows promise of new blood-based lung cancer test","explanation":"This release describes very preliminary work on a lung cancer screening test that examines blood plasma from lung cancer patients and healthy controls. The work focused on isolating specific methylated DNA  (cells that influence gene expression) markers in the blood that existed in cancer patients but which were absent in controls. The research will be presented in a poster session at an upcoming meeting of the American Association of Cancer Research (ACCR). The release gets credit for employing mostly cautious language when describing results but it comes up short in other areas; namely it omits costs, and pertinent descriptions of benefits, availability and quality of evidence. In addition, the release doesn’t mention that the study involved smokers — one has to go to the abstract to find that information — and that may lead some readers to think the screening test could be appropriate for anyone, including healthy non-smokers. In addition, red flags go up whenever we see the words “simple blood test” in a news release or story. There is no such thing, as we’ve addressed numerous times. The release points out that, “Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality, resulting in 1.7 million deaths globally and more than 150,000 deaths in the United States every year.”  (The American Cancer Society cites about 156,000 lung cancer deaths annually.) And since a lung cancer diagnosis can often come as the disease has progressed considerably, the dream of an earlier warning is enticing. There is a use for a “simple blood test” to guide further diagnostic testing in lung cancer, such as being able to differentiate benign lung nodules picked up incidentally during a chest scan from cancer. Such a test could theoretically reduce unnecessary repeat CT scans. However, readers should bring a healthy amount of skepticism to early reports about such tests and reserve confidence until substantive studies show strong, comprehensive, positive results. Otherwise, readers will suffer disappointment at believing in advances that fail to actually hold up to the hype.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":10673,"claim":"Beyond wrinkles: Botox is a salve for everything from cerebral palsy to writer’s cramp","explanation":"This is a thoroughly reported story on a medical therapy that merits skepticism but which has also earned a reasonable amount of scientific respect in recent years. It does a nice job of explaining the myriad uses of Botox in medicine today and issues some needed cautions about potential harms, nonapproved uses, and misuse. The story’s sources are plentiful and appear to be balanced. But is this enough? How good is the evidence to support the various uses of Botox? Are there reasonable alternatives to Botox for some of the conditions it treats? Is it okay to tease a national audience with a headline that shouts one thing, but place deeper in the story the caveats that suggest another? There is extraordinary variability in the quality of the research on Botox from one medical condition to another—missing information important for a national audience that inevitably includes people searching desperately for solutions to intractable problems. For example, our quick literature search turned up more than a score of randomized, controlled trials and systematic reviews on the use of Botox for the involuntary muscle contortions that cause the painful neck disorder known as cervical dystonia–and just one, very small, inadequate trial on Botox treatments for low back pain. The story fails to quantify side effects, most of which seem to be dismissed as transient. And readers might be better served if the story put more meat on the bones of alternative approaches (including no treatment) to some of the conditions Botox treats. Indeed, one could argue that the story’s ultimate effect is that of treatment mongering—simply because it shines so much (mostly flattering) light on Botox. The admonition from one source—“Don’t demand a certain treatment just because you saw a headline”—can’t compete with the magazine cover’s actual headline: “The Botox Boom” followed inside by, “You thought Botox was all about looks? It's also a salve for everything from cerebral palsy to writer's cramp”. In spite of the story’s multiple caveats about Botox, the headline hypes a therapy that may be a boon for some, but a bust for others.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10327,"claim":"Lap Band Surgery Benefits Very Obese Adolescents","explanation":"This news release summarizes an Australian study of the effect of laparoscopic adjustable gastric banding surgery (placing an adjustable silicone band around the top part of the stomach) on 21 severely obese adolescents. The release states that two-thirds of the teens lost significant amounts of weight for up to five years and further describes the procedure as “a first option” to manage obesity during adolescence. Researchers quoted in the text repeatedly and appropriately cautioned that the procedure “is not for everyone” and requires careful management, but the release remained determinedly cheery about the outcome. Importantly, it also failed to acknowledge the small sample size in this study and the lack of a control group,  as well as the health complications that stymied a few of the participants. Also ignored was that one-third of the 21 participants either failed to lose weight or began to regain it over the course of the study. Lap band surgery for severely obese teens is clearly no panacea. Obesity is a major health problem the world over, with nearly 14% of American teens identified as obese (2015 Youth Risk Behavior Surveillance System). Obesity brings with it significant physical and psychological problems, with teenagers extremely susceptible to the latter and looking for solutions that do not require behavior change. Any text advising a surgical solution for a non-surgical problem in adolescents must be grounded in sufficient data and, with even that caveat fulfilled, must be cautiously worded to make it clear that most overweight teens would be inappropriate candidates for the procedure. This release fails the first test and does not seem sufficiently worried about the second.","label":"MISLEADING"}

Five of those are firmly on the Trump agenda. That includes repealing Obamacare, building a wall along the Mexican border, deporting illegal immigrants, banning Muslims at the border, and restoring waterboarding and other torture techniques. On eliminating gun-free zones on school grounds, he hasn’t repeated it recently, but we saw no evidence he had changed his stance. There might be some debate over his plan to defund Planned Parenthood, because he links that to continued abortions. However, there is no indication that the group plans to stop providing that service, so a President Trump would need to cut funding if he wanted to keep his promise. The one exaggeration in the video is his threat to kill the families of terrorists. Trump seems to have backed off that promise. He has said he would make them suffer, not necessarily kill them.

{"claim_id":9578,"claim":"New treatment offers some hope for an unshakable tremor","explanation":"This story describes a recently FDA-approved device to treat essential tremor in patients who have not responded to medication. The ExAblate Neuro, made by Dallas-based InSightec, uses magnetic resonance images taken during the procedure to deliver focused ultrasound that destroys tissue in the thalamus, the part of the brain where tremors are believed to originate. Results of a randomized clinical trial on the device’s safety and efficacy were published this month in the New England Journal of Medicine. The story and accompanying video (seen at right) vividly illustrate rapid symptom improvements, highlighting a 72-year-old woman who says the procedure changed her life by allowing her to “eat like a normal person” and easily perform basic tasks such as signing her name and folding a scarf. This powerful patient anecdote throws the balance off: Imagine how different the story would seem if the video instead showed a patient who had improved, but also was affected by one of the serious adverse effects caused by the treatment. Also, the story needed specific numbers on the measured benefits and harms, along with a discussion of costs and alternative treatment options. Note: We also reviewed the news release that was issued to journalists about this study. While not life threatening, essential tremor can be debilitating, especially affecting people in their advanced years. The ExAblate Neuro, which the FDA calls the first focused ultrasound device to treat essential tremor in patients who have not responded to medication, offers a somewhat less invasive treatment option than traditional surgical approaches. It’s certainly newsworthy. But all of the facts, including long-term efficacy data, are not in. Stories that feature glowing patient anecdotes and positive physician commentary need to be balanced with plenty of data that can help patients and their families decide whether this treatment might be worth seeking out.","label":"true"}

About two years later, the workers reached an agreement with the growers. The coalition and the growers’ exchange both say Sanders should get some credit, although it’s likely that the agreement could have been reached without his efforts. Whether the agreement \"\"fundamentally changed the lives\"\" of the workers is difficult to quantify.

{"claim_id":9022,"claim":"Minimally invasive treatment reduces knee pain and disability from osteoarthritis","explanation":"This release outlines interim results from a small  clinical trial proposing a new treatment — geniculate artery embolization (GAE) — to reduce the pain in patients with osteoarthritis (OA) of the knee. The study was presented at the Society of Interventional Radiology’s annual meeting. The main concerns with this report are the small study size (just 13 patients) and the brief duration of the study. Outcomes include results only through 1 month after the procedure. Almost half of the patients didn’t complete the 1-month follow-up assessment. The study didn’t include a control group. The release also ignored the potential risks of the procedure and its costs. Knee pain from osteoarthritis is a growing problem among the aging population and new approaches to reduce this type of pain could improve the quality of life for many older patients. Any non-opioid or  non-surgical approach which can match the success of knee replacement surgery in resolving pain and improving function would be an advance in caring for people with disabling osteoarthritis of the knee. But this release, and the extremely early stage of this research, goes too far in its claims of benefit. Larger trials of greater duration will be needed before this new invasive approach can be seen as a ready alternative to current treatments.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":8956,"claim":"Milk protein shown to alleviate chemotherapy side effects","explanation":"The very preliminary study mentioned in this news release relies on only 12 cancer patients filling out an unvalidated questionnaire about whether taking lactoferrin supplements improved their sense of taste and smell. This is a weak news release about a weak observational study  because it provides no supporting data, never mentions how small the study is, and doesn’t explain the basic design or multiple limitations of the study. To then write a headline broadly claiming alleviation of chemotherapy side effects and state the “findings could bring relief to millions of patients undergoing cancer treatment” is a textbook example of overreaching and unjustified hype with significant potential for misleading — not “bringing relief” to millions. What this news release does do well is establish that altered taste and smell in cancer patients is a very real problem with very real consequences. An effective therapy could help millions of people and potentially make millions of dollars for those who develop such a treatment. Dangling headlines of false hope without supporting evidence is not just irresponsible, it’s potentially unethical. Avoiding this egregious level of misinformation is not difficult. At the very least it could be addressed by including study results and clearly explaining to readers what the strengths and limitations of those findings are.

{"claim_id":10001,"claim":"How To Help People Lose Weight? Give â€˜Em Free Meals and Money!","explanation":"\"This smartly written blog post manages to pack more information into a tight space than many longer pieces. We wish it had spent a little more time with the evidence behind this study on weight loss programs. For example, a MedPageToday story explained:   Clinical outcomes were not evaluated. \"\"The findings likely represent a best-case scenario, and obese patients enrolling in a similar program outside of a clinical trial setting will probably not achieve comparable results.\"\" The editorial writer \"\"cited a cohort study of Jenny Craig participants that showed that just 7% of enrollees completed a full year of the program. In contrast, 92.1% of the participants in the current study were available for the two-year follow-up. Because the program was delivered free-of-charge in the randomized trial, cost may explain the difference in adherence.\"\" The researchers \"\"acknowledged that the finding may not apply to a real-world setting because the weight-loss program was delivered at no cost. … In the current study, the participants’ average food costs would have averaged out to about $4,080 for a year, the researchers noted.\"\" Additional limitations of the study included the use of participants who were likely highly motivated to lose weight, which partially explained the low dropout rate, the use of unblinded weight-loss counselors, and the use of a control intervention that would be a likely first step for individuals seeking guidance to lose weight. Each of those is important points – and limitations that readers should have been told about – somehow – even in a short blog piece. As the story points out, the majority of Americans are either overweight or obese, and losing that weight can prove very difficult. Anyone who has picked up a lifestyle magazine knows how fat-fighting fads catch fire and then disappear. Solid research into what motivates people to lose weight and to keep it off is necessary to help guide public policy on a number of fronts.\"","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":11406,"claim":"Statins cut the risk of heart disease death by 28% among men, study shows","explanation":"This story by The Guardian highlights a new study in the journal “Circulation” that digs into the data of a 20-year study of cholesterol and heart disease in thousands of European men. The Guardian appears to lean heavily on an Imperial College press release that trumpets the benefits of taking statin drugs, which can lower LDL or “bad” cholesterol — and reduce the risk of deadly heart disease. It claims the study showed statins reduced the risk of death from heart disease by 28%. But that’s a lopsided and potentially misleading way to present the data. When broken down into absolute numbers, the benefits are far less dramatic (see quantified benefits criterion, below). In that light, the advantages compared to the disadvantages of taking statins for many years — risk of muscle pain, liver damage, diabetes, and more — become less clear. The story also misses a very big red flag when it comes to making clear that most of the authors have a financial relationship with the primary funder of the study: a drug company that makes statins. Readers need accurate data to make informed healthcare decisions. Relative numbers sound good, but are only one half of the story. Readers also deserve to know any potential conflicts of interest, such as who paid for the study.","label":"false"}

The release implies that the device could help all people who have obesity, without noting that the existing device is restricted to a subset of people. The release makes claims of benefits that have yet to be tested and does not mention harms that similar devices cause. The study was published in Nature Communications. The history of medical research is littered with “successful” animal experiments that failed to produce useful human treatments. While animal experiments that support a novel concept may be of general interest, this experimental device appears to be a refinement of an existing type of device. In this case then, the story is not the underlying concept, but whether this new device is better or worse than the existing one.

The release does not address cost, prematurely refers to the vaccine as “a breakthrough,” and does little to discuss potential harms — other than to note that phase I trials are focused on safety. The release also offers little information about the effectiveness of previous attempts to develop leprosy vaccines, which would have been valuable context. The release is clear about the potential availability of the vaccine, noting that the phase 1 trial could be completed in 2018 and that a decision to proceed with more trials will be made then. The release states, in its very first sentence, that launching this phase 1 clinical trial “marks a significant step forward in the prevention and treatment of leprosy.” That’s a bold statement, and strong claims require strong evidence. The fact is that, according to FDAReview.org, 25 percent of treatments in phase 1 trials don’t even make it to a phase 2 trial. And, according to a 2016 report from the biotech group BIO, less than 10 percent of treatments that enter phase 1 trials are eventually approved for clinical use (though the success rate rises to 11.9 percent for non-cancer drugs). The problem of overstating the accomplishment of reaching phase 1 trials is compounded by the fact that, while the release mentions previous attempts to vaccinate against leprosy, the release doesn’t mention how effective other leprosy vaccines were (or are). Entering clinical trials is only one milestone on the path to clinical use. What’s more important is how the proposed treatment performs while in those trials. The release does make this clear, much lower in the text, but it would have been stronger if it had dialed back the bold claims from the beginning.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9342,"claim":"Multigene test may find risk for heart disease, diabetes and breast cancer","explanation":"This Associated Press story describes a new approach aimed at analyzing genetic data to assess the risk to patients of developing five specific diseases, and giving people a “polygenic score.” The new approach looks at multiple genes at the same time, and the role they play, in developing these diseases. Many current genetic tests focus on seeking individual genes that have been changed. The story needed more caution–there are plenty of unknowns here. For example, even if a person knows their score, there’s no proof that having that number will improve health outcomes. What, for example, should a person do if they find out they’re at high risk for heart disease, but don’t have any signs of it? Also, false-positive and false-negative results could be significant. Predicting a person’s risk for serious and life-threatening diseases is valuable, both to the individual and to public health. So any refined improvement in how we gauge that risk is a true benefit. But this story uses the findings from one effort looking at a British database and extrapolates too broadly without offering readers the kinds of information they need to gauge whether there is great promise here, or just more hype.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10565,"claim":"Unlocking Puzzles Inside The Brain: ADHD","explanation":"\"Brain imaging for neurological disorders is an exciting, fast-moving and very promising area of research. This segment (and a companion piece aired the day before on autism) reports on clinical application of MRIs and EEGs by a well qualified neurologist. Dr. Fernando Miranda’s clinical work puts him at the forefront of treatment for ADHD and other neurological conditions. But his work is also in some ways ahead of the research, which is inconclusive and still in early stages. He also operates a clinic that sells this service, creating a conflict of interest. The segment’s serious flaw is its failure to put Dr. Miranda’s work in the context of the research, which has been done for over a decade, funded by government agencies and published in top medical journals. The segment dwells on anecdotes suggesting benefit without really exploring the underlying questions: Does the science justify the treatment Miranda giving? What are his results aside from the anecdotal? What have other researchers and clinicians–those who do not operate for-profit clinics offering the service–found when using similar techniques? What are the objections of well-informed dissenters? The use of a single brief quote \"\"for\"\" and one \"\"against\"\" doesn’t illuminate any of the underlying issues. Having said all that, the report is commendable in two ways:  The reporter is careful, especially at the end, not to oversell the diagnostic approach, calling it one additional technique that can help with ADHD or other disorder diagnosis. The network provides a more detailed written version of this report on its web site–a broadcast journalism best practice. The question that dogs this piece is why the producers would choose to ignore all the important research being done in the field. One fears it’s to make the story appear more edgy, more of a breakthough, more of an exclusive. If so, it does not serve viewers well.\"","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9625,"claim":"New Eczema Treatments Could Be Available Soon","explanation":"This story is an overview about a couple of drugs that treat eczema by preventing the immune system from overreacting. So far, the drugs are faring well in clinical trials, and the companies behind them plan to seek FDA approval later this year. This story is clear that availability of the drugs must await that approval, but the headline—New Eczema Treatments Could Be Available Soon—ignores the uncertainty surrounding FDA drug approvals. (We saw a similar level of excessive optimism in our review of a news release on a different drug: PR release on mid-stage eczema drug trial suggests benefit but doesn’t quantify.) The new drugs may, as sources attest, be “safer and potentially more effective” than existing medications. But the story gives short shrift to explaining the clinical evidence underlying those conclusions and offers no information about potential conflicts of interest among the sources. Atopic dermatitis, or eczema, afflicts millions of individuals and is so severe in an estimated 1.6 million that it limits social life and leads to bouts of depression and suicidal thoughts. Steroid creams help but bring with them long-term side effects. Newer immune modulator drugs may minimize side effects while providing substantial relief.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9420,"claim":"Stem Cells for Knee Problems? U.S. Doctors Investigate","explanation":"The focus of this story seems to be this question: Where do we stand with regard to stem cells helping with wear-and-tear arthritis (osteoarthritis) of the knees? The story does well in giving some background regarding stem cells, and how this is apparently a growing trend. The story would have been strengthened considerably by including the potential harms of treatments, the costs of stem cells vs. conventional therapy and discussing the alternatives more thoroughly. Osteoarthritis of the knee (like lower back pain) is one of the most common, but difficult-to-treat orthopedic ailments in the Western world. Given that we’re living longer, and experiencing historically high levels of obesity, this problem is expected to become even more common. With this will come a growing demand for non-surgical interventions (although injecting stem cells into the knee joint is still invasive). Health claims about stem cells have exploded and include advertised benefits for everything from Alzheimer’s disease and multiple sclerosis to erectile dysfunction and blindness. This means journalists have a big opportunity to educate the public regarding what we do know — and what we don’t know — about this emerging technology. Also, it’s important to note that academic medical centers also have been making misleading claims about stem cells–it’s not just private clinics.","label":"MISLEADING"}

No benefit quantification. No risk mention. No comparison to alternatives. There were too many things missing from this release on the safety and efficacy of stereotactic body radiation in elderly patients with lung cancer to allow a reporter or patient to judge whether this was really an interesting scientific finding. Lung cancer is a life-threatening disease at any age and news about treatments are of interest to a wide audience. This release describes results from an observational study of patients treated for early stage lung cancer with stereotactic body radiation treatment (SBRT) between 2004 and 2014. The release notes that the study looked at treatment outcomes broken down by age and suggests that treatment benefits were similar, but the release didn’t describe any harms from SBRT treatment and whether they varied by patient age. In order to justify a claim that SBRT should be used in people over 80 years old researchers would need comparative data showing that SBRT outcomes in this elderly population are superior to other forms of radiation and other treatments.

Readers of this story will see the new results as a useful addition to other evidence on the value of mammography screening.

And it doesn’t explain, in terms of actual food, how much worse (or better) a diet had to be to be linked to cognitive deficits (or improvements). It didn’t compare the effects of diet with other factors — such as talking to and interacting with children — that have been linked to better cognitive development in other studies. Parents are very interested in strategies that can help their kids do better in school and get ahead in life. But they don’t always focus on approaches that are well supported by the evidence (remember “Baby Einstein“?). While it makes sense that a nutritious diet might have beneficial effects on brain development, the data so far are preliminary and the effects observed are small. If these limitations aren’t carefully explained, the results might distract parents from other strategies that have better evidence to support their effectiveness.

{"claim_id":10536,"claim":"Cancer drug dramatically shrinks prostate tumors, study finds","explanation":"\"This Los Angeles Times story reports on research into abiraterone, a new drug being studied to treat aggressive prostate cancer. The report overstates the importance of early research and improperly anticipates the findings of studies not yet completed. It predicts approval and arrival on the market the same year as the lead investigator, whose work is funded by the drug’s patent holder. It garbles the findings in a way that exaggerates the benefits shown. These significant shortcomings are unfortunate. The story itself, unlike many that involve early stage trials, is probably worth reporting. The drug operates by a novel mechanism and appears to be very effective against a fatal form of cancer that resists most treatments. A number of other studies are underway and experts in the field are genuinely hopeful this drug will provide an effective treatment for aggressive cancer. With a few key additions, the story could have been more responsible. The report should have said the results are from a Phase I trial and that efficacy and safety have not been proven. In order to justify its enthusiasm, the story should have provided some detail about what similar published studies have found. The reporter should have described the benefits shown in the research more accurately. The story should have said the drug may not be approved; it should not have predicted a date for an event that is not certain to happen. It should not have speculated that the drug \"\"could find use among most\"\" of the 28,000 U.S. men diagnosed with aggressive prostate cancer each year.

{"claim_id":11405,"claim":"Computers help docs spot breast cancer on X-rays","explanation":"This well-reported story on a study of computer-aided detection (CAD) of problems found in mammograms follows most health journalism best practices. But two related flaws, and one contextual issue, prevent it from providing a higher level of reader service. As the ratings above show, the reporter provides necessary information about evidence and outcomes, and does an excellent job with sourcing. It communicates very clearly the conclusion that one radiologist using CAD appears to be as effective in identifying cancers as two radiologists reading the same images. The flaw is that the story fails to compare the benefit of these practices to the most common method of diagnosis used in the U.S.–a single reading by one radiologist. The published study itself reveals that double readings have been shown to be 4 to 14 percent more effective at detection than single readings, with a meta-analysis showing a 10 percent advantage. Combined with the report’s failure to directly compare costs of single-reader, double-reader and single-reader-with-CAD methods, the reader isn’t able to understand the real trade-offs facing the U.S. medical system: the cost of missed cancers vs. the cost of additional technology. And finally, when dealing with mammography it’s important for reporters to understand the underlying challenge is not simply to identify cancers, but to identify the cancers that matter. It has not been demonstrated that diagnosing more cases of breast cancer reduces mortality or incidence of invasive cancers. This fact is always worth mentioning in stories about the benefits of cancer detection.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":10107,"claim":"Cracking The Conundrum Of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome","explanation":"It starts out with some good framing around the problem of diagnosing and treating chronic fatigue, but then, in a story that demands specifics, it provides only one number, noting that the study examined “over 600 patients.” The rest of the story contains statements such as, “Doctors say some treatments can help.” Which ones? It also says that “a form of talk therapy, as well as exercise, offered relief for some patients.” How many? We like that the story tapped some outside expertise to put the study’s findings in context, but the story was too short in other areas. Chronic fatigue syndrome, as the story notes, is one of the most elusive disorders in modern medicine. Is it truly a single syndrome? Is it several disorders that are ill defined and difficult to pinpoint and so end up being tossed under the same umbrella? Is it all in the patient’s mind? it can be a devastating condition – affecting physical, emotional function and financial well-being. Because science has yielded few clues to the origin and true nature of the syndrome, it is all the more important for journalists to write with precision when addressing a new scientific attempt to address chronic fatigue. This was particularly important for a controversial study like the one here because many people interpreted the study to mean that chronic fatigue is a psychological disorder.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":11612,"claim":"Statins May Guard Against Rheumatoid Arthritis","explanation":"\"This story about an association between long-term statin use and a lower risk of rheumatoid arthritis covers many of the bases, but it doesn’t do as good a job as the other story we reviewed at giving readers a sense of the preliminary nature of the research. While we applaud stories that include specific numbers, this one probably left many readers scratching their heads about what the numbers meant. For example, the story reported that “those not taking statins had a 51 percent higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis over about 80 percent of the follow-up period.” Huh? Many of the numbers quoted are provided without context and as a result provide little in the way of information. Giving readers an easier statistic, such as \"\"number needed to treat\"\" would have cut through the confusion and provided important context to the true impact of the study. Like the other story we reviewed, this one fails to put the reported difference in rheumatoid arthritis rates in perspective. It reports the percentage reduction without telling readers the baseline risk for this population. Indeed, like the other story, it reports that among almost 2 million people included in the database analyzed by researchers just a couple of thousand people developed rheumatoid arthritis over the course of a decade. That is a rate of about one-tenth of one percent. While a “40 percent” reduction sounds big, it is impossible to tell from this story just how many people might be affected. An association is not the same as an effect. News reports of research should be consistent and precise in the use of the terms in order to avoid creating an impression of a causal relationship when one has not been demonstrated.\"","label":"MISLEADING"}

However, readers also get a headline and lead that leap to the conclusion (unsupported by this study) that aspirin may cause death rates to drop. The story also misleads readers by failing to point out that what the researchers reported were differences in deaths from prostate cancer, not deaths overall. The caution about the relative lack of peer review scrutiny of studies presented at medical meetings is welcome. Is there some important difference between prostate cancer patients who take aspirin or other anticoagulants and those who don’t? And could that difference explain some or all of the differences in death rates? This type of study can’t answer that question.

{"claim_id":8971,"claim":"Preliminary Data from Study Demonstrates 94% Accuracy in Detecting Aggressive Prostate Cancer","explanation":"This news release is about a blood test intended to more specifically define a man’s likelihood of having a high-grade prostate cancer tumor. It alerts readers several times to the preliminary nature of the small “proof of concept” study. However, highlighting a “94% accuracy” in the headline and lead paragraph is unjustified. The release does not mention cost, nor does it adequately discuss potential benefits or harms. The release implies that this test offers something unique, but it fails to tell readers that other blood tests are much farther along in the research process. “Preliminary,” “proof of concept” and references to the need to confirm and expand the findings of a study all point out how much more work needs to be done in order to find out if this experimental blood test might offer anything of value. Putting a number on the “accuracy” of the test, especially without defining or explaining details of the assessment, implies a level of certainty that does not exist. It is well known that the PSA test for prostate cancer screening isn’t very reliable. There are several efforts underway to develop improved tests. The biggest problem is that the PSA test isn’t very specific — meaning that a man with an abnormal test result may not have cancer. That is termed a “false positive” test. Even among those with an abnormal PSA test who are diagnosed with cancer, many of these cancers (some experts suggest up to 40%) may be so small or otherwise innocuous that they really should be left alone. Can a new test be developed that identifies cancers that need to be treated more accurately than the currently available tests? As presented, a reader may surmise that this new test looks promising, but for a number of reasons it may be “too good to be true.” First, we don’t know very much about the men studied, but often patients in such initial studies are more likely to have prostate cancers that need treatment. When later the test is applied to a larger, more diverse population, the test may not perform as well. Moreover, the definition of what is a cancer that requires treatment is not clearly stated in this release. We know that the referenced Gleason score which is based upon the biopsy specimen isn’t perfect either and we’re not sure what criteria was used in this study. Finally, any new test that cuts down on false positive results is likely to lead to missing some cancers that really do need treatment. These are termed false negative test results.","label":"false"}

Varicosities are very common, and for the vast majority of people, do not pose health risks.

{"claim_id":9477,"claim":"Silicon Valley Startup Grail Sees Hope for Cancer Blood Test","explanation":"This story about a blood test for nasopharyngeal carcinoma focuses on the business angles of the research as much as on the potential health contributions of a new screening test. It clearly reports that there is much work to be done before such a test could be considered for clinical use. It passes along a calculation by the researchers that detecting one case would cost almost $30,000 based on the results of this study. However, the story also says that the test is more accurate than existing methods and “boosted patients’ chances of survival,”even though this study was not designed to test either of those claims. The story should have been clearer about how rare this type of cancer is. The participants in this study had a rate of cancer many, many times higher than the general population in the US, which would greatly affect both its effectiveness and its cost. The comment that the cancer “is prevalent” in southern China and Southeast Asia is misleading–it’s more prevalent, but rates are still on the order of 10 to 20 per 100,000. It would have been nice to see more context from an independent source. Stories about medical studies should never proclaim findings that the studies were not designed to produce. This story includes several cautious descriptions of the study as a proof-of-concept and something that provides a “glimpse of evidence” that a blood test might be able to detect at least one rare type of cancer. However, the story states this test is more accurate than existing methods, despite the fact that the study did not directly compare the new test to standard clinical diagnosis. It also claims the test boosted survival, even though again there was no direct comparison to standard care. The relative accuracy and survival claims stick out from the rest of the reporting in a way that suggests they might have been added to juice up the impact of the story.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":9759,"claim":"One-two punch of two generics for breast cancer may be more powerful than wonder drug tamoxifen","explanation":"This story looks at two classes of drugs – aromatase inhibitors and bisphosphonates – which it says may deliver a “powerful one-two punch” when treating breast cancer. It reports on two Lancet studies that compiled data from 9 and 26 trials, respectively – what are known as meta-analyses. The studies reported on are newsworthy and there’s certainly some interesting and useful information here. But what’s missing from the piece are key details, including the fact that these drugs can cause significant side effects that may lead some women to stop taking them. Consulting an independent expert may have shed light on this issue for readers. We also think some of the language used in the story was misleading. The headline focuses the “one-two punch” of using the two types of drugs in combination, but there is no evidence in either meta-analysis to support combining the two drugs. Since that wasn’t an element of the research being reported on, why leap to that in a headline? Aromatase inhibitors have long interested scientists as an alternative to tamoxifen, the standard therapy for estrogen receptor(ER)-positive breast cancer, which may increase the risks for uterine cancer, blood clots and eye problems. Standard interventions range from surgery to drug therapy and are often invasive and toxic, sometimes causing side effects that appear months or years after treatment has ended. While non-invasive therapies found to be effective and to reduce the severity of side effects are newsworthy, readers should know that aromatase inhibitors are only used in women who’ve undergone menopause — either natural menopause or induced (e.g. by chemotherapy, oophorectomy, etc). In addition, aromatase inhibitors are not new and have been used both after a breast cancer diagnosis and to prevent breast cancer for some time. Significant side effects of aromatase inhibitors and bisphosphonates lead many women to stop taking them.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10999,"claim":"2 Weeks of Antibiotic Therapy Relieves IBS","explanation":"This story on a pharma-funded study indicating that antibiotics may hold promise for people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) overplayed the study’s actual findings and spent too little time analyzing the evidence. This one did a better job than the AP story in identifying the conflicts of interest of the people it quoted, but that does not absolve it of the bigger failure: failing to find any independent sources to provide some much needed context and critical analysis. Irritable bowel syndrome is a chronic condition that has perplexed researchers. Drug companies are hungry for an effective treatment so that they can tap into what appears to be a significant market — representing either 15% or 20% of the population, depending on whose numbers you believe. Regulators typically set a high bar for a drug to be marketed to patients for broad use, which is why the antibiotic treatment described is still under review and only available for off label use. Reporters should set a similarly high bar and not allow drug company hype or individual success stories sway them away from the hard data. Instead of a marketing-style headline such as “2 weeks of antibiotic therapy relieves IBS” — can’t you see that on an advertisement during a football game? — the story could have just as easily said, “Most people don’t see relief of symptoms after taking expensive antibiotics” – or that more than 30% of those taking a placebo did find relief.","label":"false"}

Ample independent researchers were included, and the measured benefits of the intervention are stated clearly. Sleep deprivation is common among folks who work night shifts, and even among the general public. While societal calls for getting a good 7 to 8 hours’ sleep—still the only proven remedy for the problem—are growing, both the sleep-deprived and their physicians continue to seek ways to manage sleepiness, from caffeine consumption to cars that notice sloppy driving patterns and suggest the driver take a break.

{"claim_id":11622,"claim":"New method could make IVF more effective","explanation":"This year’s Nobel Prize in Medicine went to Robert Edwards, a UK physiologist who, over 30 years ago, developed the technique for in-vitro fertilization (IVF). Since then, IVF has become an enourmous industry. An individual cycle of IVF can cost $10-15,000 but the average chance of success is roughly 1 in 5 (varying widely according to many factors). Therefore, any improvements in the technique to improve the success rate is welcome news to potential parents. This story reports on a new technique that entails observing the embryo divide and develop to attempt to predict which ones would have the highest chance of success. While this method may be truly an advancement in IVF technology, this story does little to educate readers on its potential importance. It provides inadequate information about the availability, costs and potential harms of IVF. It does not discuss the strength of the evidence to support the new technique nor does it describe the success rates of the procedure compared to existing methods. The story does not quote any independent sources that could have provided some perspective on the importance of the results, which is sorely missing from this story. Most distressing, the story exagerrates the perils of pregnancy by providing such scary statistics as the 50% miscarriage rate. In doing so, it overstates the need for reproductive assistance technologies, including IVF. In the end, this story appears to be little more than a thinly-veiled advertisement for IVF, an industry which is in little need of help. Couples who seek to have children using IVF face high costs and frequent failures. Stories on this topic must tread carefully to not raise unwarranted hopes.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":9875,"claim":"Back Surgery Not Always the Cure for Pain","explanation":"Too often, back surgery is touted as a miracle cure with amazing results. Little attention is given to the fact that few people with back pain are actually candidates for surgery and that it is still unclear whether people end up better off than if they had chosen a non-surgical route. This ABC news story does a decent job of describing these controversies, although the story is flawed in several ways. The story provides good information on how the likelihood of having the surgery in the U.S. is so much higher than in other countries. Although the story mentions spinal fusion and physical therapy as alternatives to discectomy, the story should have discussed other options and the pros and cons of each option. The story explains that there is not good evidence that surgery is better than non-surgical therapy. However, the story should have further described the strength of the available evidence. The story does not quantify the benefit of treatment, does not explain if laparoscopic surgery is novel or not, does not mention costs, and other than to say that sugery is often unnecessary, the story does not discuss harms of treatment, which can be substantial. Publisher’s note: this story was part of a series on back pain airing that week on ABC World News Tonight. The network should be applauded for dedicating extra time to this important consumer health issue.","label":"MISLEADING"}

However, the release left out some key details. Are there risks associated with this technique? What sort of expenses are involved for patients? What sort of questions and concerns are still outstanding? The release does tell readers that the transplant was done as part of a phase 1 clinical trial — and that future trials will address whether the technique is effective. Which raises the question: Why are they issuing a news release now? According to the National Kidney Foundation, there are tens of thousands of people on the waiting list for a kidney donation — with thousands more being added to the list each month. That means there a lot of people, and their loved ones, who are anxious for good news regarding kidney donation. Trumpeting one successful kidney transplant that took advantage of an experimental ex vivo organ perfusion technique may well raise hopes for no reason. At best, it will likely be years before the technique finds widespread clinical use — it is, after all, in the earliest of clinical trials. We do not know how long those clinical trials will take, or if the technique will even advance beyond a phase 1 clinical trial. We do not know if the technique may cause unforeseen problems even in the patient who has received this initial transplant. And there is no discussion of cost or potential risks — both of which are significant issues for patients.","label":"false"}

Note: We also reviewed the news release.

{"claim_id":9675,"claim":"A Vaginal Ring Could Prevent HIV, Two Huge Studies Just Found","explanation":"Vaginal ring. Credit: International Partnership for Microbicides This article discusses two studies surrounding a new device for preventing HIV infection. The device is a vaginal ring that dispenses an antiviral compound called dapivirine which can prevent the spread of HIV in women, according to scientists presenting their research at a medical conference. The device must be worn daily and replaced monthly in order to be effective. One of the studies described was published in the New England Journal of Medicine (NEJM) and the other was an unpublished abstract. The ring contains an antiviral agent that works against the virus, but experts caution this method only seems to curb about 27 percent of transmissions from one sexual partner to the other. This story does a good job of providing context, although we would have liked a more cautious headline (and less use of the word “huge,” in general, in the text) and a better definition of pre-exposure prophylaxis since previous efforts have mainly focused on treating those who already contracted the virus. We applaud the careful way the story gave details of the two research studies, including their size and length and where they were conducted. Because sub-Saharan Africa is hardest hit by HIV, and has few health resources, we wish the story had included discussion of how much the ring will cost. Women and men worldwide are at risk of catching the HIV virus from sexual partners. While there are precautions that might limit the spread, they are often not under the control of women. This vaginal ring, with a compound that interferes with the virus, could be worn discreetly by women to protect themselves. While the 27 percent effectiveness may seem modest, these two studies being reported raise a new hope for putting control of limiting the spread of the virus into more women’s hands.","label":"MISLEADING"}

First, we don’t actually know how many people have died in the last month. Clinton’s statement is based on 2013 data from the CDC, which tallied nearly 3,000 gun deaths per month that year. There’s not more recent data available. Experts say the number of gun deaths this year is likely to be similar to or higher than 2013, so Clinton’s claim is probably not too far off. But we can’t know for sure. Also, it’s likely that at roughly half of these deaths are due to suicide. It could be even higher. Clinton’s phrasing obscures that point.

{"claim_id":10867,"claim":"A Genetic Test for Prospective Parents","explanation":"\"This Wall Street Journal story hits many of the right marks when describing a test created by a Silicon Valley start-up, Counsyl Inc., that allows prospective parents to determine  whether they carry genes that could lead to their children having specific hereditary diseases. Such tests have been available previously. The news here is that this company’s innovation makes testing far cheaper and easier. The Journal found the test so remarkable it gave it a Bronze award as part of its annual awards for technology innovation. We did not find the story about the test quite as remarkable, mainly because it did not thoroughly explain the evidence behind this advance and the risks involved with genetic screening. The story itself makes it clear why a better genetic test — and careful coverage of the test — matter. \"\"Proponents of universal prepregnancy genetic screening make a bold claim: If these tests were widely available, they could significantly reduce, and possibly eliminate, hereditary diseases.\"\" To test that bold claim, stories like these need to provide more of the evidence to readers in easy to understand terms. If the test can help individuals considering having children who may be at high risk for a genetic defect, it does not mean that it will help an individual who is worried about genetic defects, but not at high risk. The reason is that as the likelihood that the person has a genetic defect falls, the ability of the test to differentiate between a false positive and a true positive gets harder. False alarms for prospective parents could be devastating. There isn’t even the briefest mention of this incredibly important issue.\"","label":"MISLEADING"}

As we state below in our “Evidence” criterion: “We aren’t told if the symptom improvement is clinically meaningful. After all, IBS is a chronic condition and this is a short-term study. And most importantly, the reporting is confusing: “Changes in quality of life …..were not significantly different…. but all were much improved at the 3-month followup in the meditation group.”  And no explanation was given of how symptom changes were measured. Or what was meant by “all were much improved at the three-month followup.”  That’s a big weakness in the story.”  Many people are interested in non-medical approaches to improving health. Mindfulness meditation and other complemenary and alternative therapies, along with exercise and nutritional recommendations are of high interest.

{"claim_id":9528,"claim":"How optimism may help you live longer","explanation":"A story by CBS news plays up a new study in the American Journal of Epidemiology that could give anyone reason to feel optimistic: Optimism itself is linked to a longer life, at least based on a survey of professional nurses over the years. The survey used by the researchers was the Nurses’ Health Study (NHS), which reaches out to tens of thousands of medical nurses every 2 years and asks them basic questions. The data is often used to help guide public policy. The story attempts to lay out the potential benefits of optimism and their relation to various diseases and longevity–but it did so using relative risk numbers, which are not reflective of the true impact. The story also missed an important discussion about how much the results could stem from having good health–that perhaps this causes the optimism, and not vice versa. Also, no independent sources–who could provide insight and some skepticism–were included. Most everyone on Earth wants to live longer, but we often have trouble picking the healthy behaviors that lead to longevity. If a sense of optimism — a totally cost-free medical intervention — could help encourage the right behaviors, extend lifespan, and improve the quality of life, that’d be a boon around the world. Unfortunately, it’s a devilishly tricky question to ask, given the strong counterargument: Maybe healthy people just feel more optimistic because they’re doing well, while sick or injured people have a lot more to worry about and feel more pessimistic. This nuance is important to convey to readers given the limitations of this study–how it couldn’t prove cause and effect.","label":"MISLEADING"}

We commend the release for noting that the study findings show a correlation, not causation, and for making a call for more research. However, the largest drawback of the release is that it doesn’t provide any actual data from the study. The release did call out some limitations of the research but would have been even stronger had it mentioned some very obvious differences between the group of mothers-to-be that took multivitamins and the expectant mothers who did not take supplements. The multivitamin group is more educated, in a higher socioeconomic group, has fewer smokers, are of more normal weight, more were born in Sweden and more were experiencing their first pregnancy. The presence of a higher percentage of women with overweight in the no vitamin group suggests that there are other nutritional factors that are unknown and may influence or increase the risk of having a child with ASD. Environmental factors in autism spectrum disorder are an area of active research as the prevalence of diagnosis has doubled since the year 2000. (Genetic influences are also actively studied.) Because these disorders are developmental in nature, prenatal influences are of particular interest.

{"claim_id":9480,"claim":"Flattening The 'Mummy Tummy' With 1 Exercise, 10 Minutes A Day","explanation":"A reporter shares her personal experience taking an exercise class aimed at flattening what she calls her “mummy tummy,” the abdominal bulge more formally known as diastasis recti, a separation of abdominal muscles after pregnancy. The story provides a lot of good details and explanations for the science behind the problem. Many sources were consulted for the story, and costs of the treatment were made clear. However, the story didn’t delve into the lack of research quite enough here–it posited one small, pilot study as fairly strong evidence that this method works. That may be the case, but that’s hard to know until more rigorous research is done, especially randomized research with a control group. The mixture of the reporter’s own positive impressions of the limited medical research behind this technique could leave readers believing there is substantial proof that it works. A few more cautionary details would have helped the piece on this front.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":10024,"claim":"Sleep Fights Colds, Study Finds","explanation":"This story suggests that a good night’s sleep might be important for fending off the common cold. It features some useful information about the study that’s the basis for the story and includes valuable comments from an independent expert. But it could have done some things better — particularly with the language it uses to characterize the findings and its discussion of alternatives to getting more Zs for staying cold-free. The problems begin with the headline: “Sleep fights colds, study finds.” Well, maybe. “Because we didn’t actually manipulate someone’s sleep, we can’t know whether it was a causative effect,” lead author Aric Prather told HealthNewsReview.org in a telephone interview. “That’s Methodology 101.” It’s important to acknowledge that reporters often have no control over their headlines — nevertheless, we think the issue of misleading headlines is important and needs to be addressed. For more concerns about the presentation of the findings, see “Quality of Evidence” below. The question of how much sleep is optimal is important and largely unanswered. We know that humans get different amounts of sleep at different points in their lives, so age is clearly related to this issue. But it remains unclear how much sleep optimizes health. Though the study described in this piece does not address this larger issue, it attempts to get at this by focusing on the risk of infection. Here the common cold was induced artificially in a controlled setting among healthy individuals. The study found that those who, at baseline, slept more, were less likely to develop an objectively defined cold after being inoculated with the cold virus. This appears to be a well-done study, but doesn’t really answer the key question: If I sleep more, will I get fewer colds? That important question requires a different study to answer. Moreover, this study was done in artificial conditions. The more practical question is, If I sleep more during the cold season, will I be less likely to get a cold? Again, not something that this study, well-performed though it was, is capable of answering.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":11377,"claim":"Low-Salt Diet Ineffective, Study Finds. Disagreement Abounds.","explanation":"Two stories we reviewed on this study about salt intake showed how two well meaning journalists could come to very different conclusions about how to present this information. The New York Times story took the most cautious approach, weighing the preponderance of evidence linking salt to heart disease against this single study with several limitations and giving more weight to the preponderance of evidence. The USA Today story decided to give both the critics of the study and the study itself equal weight and took the odd step of bringing in the salt industry. This is not “fair and balanced” journalism. This is he said\/she said that lacks critical analysis and leaves readers frustrated and confused. For years, high salt intake has been suggested as a cause of heart disease and early death. Researching the impact of salt, or any dietary factor, on health can be tricky, as both of these stories explain, and this study attempted to provide a deeper look at the connection between salt and health. But, as the authors themselves acknowledge in the paper, there are significant limitations to this study that should have given reporters more pause when reporting the findings. The biggest one was acknowledged by the New York Times in saying, “was observational, considered at best suggestive and not conclusive.” USA Today missed this point.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":10124,"claim":"Antibiotic eases common stomach pain, studies find","explanation":"AP included cost information, and this is a significant factor that should not have been ignored by other stories. At the same time, the lack of independent experts was a flaw. This is underscored by an unrepresentative anecdote from a glowing patient success story, even though the study itself showed that the vast majority of people did not get adequate relief. And the placebo effect alone was  significant. Because IBS treatment has been a frustrating experience for so many, even a modest improvement in symptoms that lasts a few months may be worthwhile for some. This appears to be a novel way of treating IBS, and the fact that symptoms improved at all is of interest, even if the duration of the study was short. At $21 a pill, though, one could ask hard questions about how many people are actually going to benefit and whether the treatment is a cost-effective alternative.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":10249,"claim":"Fish Oil Seems to Help Cancer Patients Preserve Muscle","explanation":"The story used quotes given in a news release – and was wrong in stating that the findings were already published in the Feb. 28 online edition of Cancer. The story was published early this morning – but at 2 pm Central time, we checked with the editorial office of the journal and the study had not yet been posted online. That’s not the journalists’ responsibility but it is their responsibility to be accurate and for hours the story was inaccurate because it said the study was online when it was not. So any reader who may have wanted to track down the article couldn’t – for hours at least. at 4:30 pm Central time, we see that the study is now posted online. This obviously raises issues not only about the journalism process but about the journal and its news releases processes, since the journal’s news release also erroneously jumped the gun in stating that the study was posted online far before it had been. More importantly, the story never discussed the limitations of a small (16 people in the active arm of the trial), short-term (10-week) study. This is an important area of research. The researchers wrote: “more than 65% of advanced nonsmall cell lung cancer cases do not respond to first-line chemotherapy, and 1-year survival rates are low.”  But this story didn’t evaluate the quality of the evidence, didn’t give enough context on other research in this field, and didn’t report on limitations of such prelminary work. Yet it said this “raises hope.”  That’s the kind of statement that should probably await more evidence in bigger, longer studies.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":9223,"claim":"Mayo Clinic finds surprising results on first-ever test of stem cell therapy to treat arthritis","explanation":"This release from the Mayo Clinic describes the essentially negative results of a small, randomized and partly controlled trial of a widely used, but unproven treatment for arthritis. The treatment involves injecting a person’s own bone marrow containing pluripotent stem cells directly into arthritis-damaged knees. Popular in “regenerative medicine” clinics, Bone Marrow \u0010Aspirate Concentrate (BMAC) therapy, and a related therapy using Platelet Rich Plasma (PRP) from blood, cost many thousands of dollars and are not covered by insurance. BMAC therapy currently does not require FDA approval since many of its practitioners have argued successfully that harvesting cells from one’s own body and re-injecting them without complex processing does not constitute “a drug.” But neither has there been rigorous scientific testing for efficacy, adverse side effects, benefit compared with other treatments, and safety. The good news is that the Mayo Clinic study was designed to put some science behind a choice to use BMAC, which a few published articles conclude has helped many patients and for long periods of time. The release notes that the study failed to make a scientific case that the therapy works to heal, cure or diminish osteoarthritic pain mainly because the 25 patients — each with two bad knees — served as their own controls for BMAC and it turns out that the “control” knees injected with plain saline benefited just as much as the stem cell treated knees. Overall, the release uses weaselly language to give the stem cell treatment more benefit of the doubt than it deserves here, and devotes a lot of space making a case for the possibility that the injection of stem cells in one set of knees somehow “spread” systemically to the other knees. A meaningful discussion of harms and benefits are also missing. Painful, debilitating osteoarthritis of the knees and other joints, especially in the elderly and in athletes, joggers, and sports enthusiasts, are a major cause of disability. Treatments with anti-inflammatories, steroids, surgery and painkillers all carry potential risks and the overall health care cost to individuals and society is significant. As the release notes, at least 600 stem cell clinics in the U.S. alone have offered at least one form of BMAC to more than 100,000 patients seeking cures or long-lasting pain-reducing treatment. This study seeks to assess whether the use of a patient’s own bone marrow stem cells is a treatment for osteoarthritis, or arthritis of aging. This treatment and similar ones seek to find an option that is less invasive than surgery but more effective than existing treatments. The investigators report that both knees improved “dramatically,” but unexpectedly. The knee injected with the salt water solution did just as well as the knee injected with the active stem cell treatment. In summary, the study is an important one in that it calls into question the unproven benefit of using a patient’s own bone marrow as a treatment for painful arthritis. Further studies should include double-blind design where one patient gets stem cells while another only gets the saline placebo.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9561,"claim":"Blood Clot Removal Could Help More Stroke Victims, Study Finds","explanation":"The news story focuses on a recent JAMA article that reports some stroke patients would benefit from surgically removing a blood clot — via a process called endovascular thrombectomy — up to 7.3 hours after stroke symptoms appear. This is a departure from existing guidelines, which say the surgery should only be done within 6 hours of the onset of symptoms. The story does a good job of illustrating how the new research findings may affect the current standard of care for stroke patients–though it should have been clearer about which patients are eligible for this surgery. Also, the story only addresses costs indirectly, and does not address potential risks associated with endovascular thrombectomy nor adequately quantify the potential benefits of the surgical intervention. Strokes are a big deal. According to the CDC, strokes account for 5 percent of deaths in the United States; more than 795,000 people have a stroke each year in the U.S.; and strokes are estimated to cost the U.S. $34 billion each year. Given the number of people affected by strokes — both patients and their loved ones — new research on stroke treatment is big news. This is not only because it may reduce mortality, but because the type and quality of treatment in the hours immediately following the stroke can have an enormous impact on a patient’s independence — affecting the quality of life for both patients and their loved ones. For all of these reasons, it is important for news about stroke treatment to clearly outline potential risks, costs and benefits associated with various treatment options. The story does a fair job here, but there is room for improvement.","label":"MISLEADING"}

These included two sham-controlled trials on the treatment of chronic knee pain and one sham-controlled trial on the management of chronic back pain. Curiously, it also included discussion of a small study comparing acupuncture to an antidepressant for hot flashes among breast cancer patients. By its design, this study wasn’t capable of separating the specific treatment effects of acupuncture from placebo responses. Yet it is presented as if it were relevant to this issue. The column offered a variety of rationales on why acupuncture might not produce optimal results in conventional, sham-controlled clinical trials. But it didn’t balance out this discussion by considering whether the growing number of trials questioning acupuncture’s treatment impact might simply be correct. The story included quotes from four researchers or independent experts. However, three of the four appeared to be proponents of acupuncture. Revising Study Results An example of the article’s apparent tilt towards acupuncture came in discussion of a recent trial on the treatment of painful knee osteoarthritis from Texas. That study concluded that both acupuncture and sham acupuncture produced identical improvements in pain scores: roughly one point on a seven-point scale (J-MAP). However, the New York Times article proposed altering that conclusion through sleight-of-hand. It noted that the patients would have received a different, non-standardized program of acupuncture in the “real world.” And that the study conclusions could be revised to suggest that acupuncture “works even when administered poorly.”   The columnist didn’t discuss the possibility that acupuncture might actually perform worse in a real-world setting where patients don’t have to meet strict study inclusion criteria. And the article didn’t consider whether a one-point improvement on a seven-point pain scale would be considered evidence that a treatment “works”. Overall, the article did not provide a clear view of the larger body of evidence on the risks, benefits, availability, or costs of acupuncture for any condition. And it did not adequately stress the key take-home message in this area: that sham-controlled clinical trials have not yet documented that acupuncture has a clinically important treatment effect—and that this is a gaping hole in its evidence base. (Manheimer et al., 2007; Sherman et al., 2009). Acupuncture is a widely publicized complementary\/alternative therapy for pain and other physical and psychological symptoms. However, acupuncture is not widely utilized in the United States. Only about 4% of the U.S. population had ever tried acupuncture, according to a nationwide study in 2002, and only about 1% had utilized it recently. One of the major obstacles to broader use of acupuncture is a lack of scientific evidence that it is superior to sham or fake acupuncture. In several areas of medicine—such as the treatment of knee pain, headache, and chronic back pain—acupuncture appears to be superior to usual treatment or no treatment. However, it does not appear to offer any clinically significant benefit over a sham procedure—according to recent reviews of the evidence. (Manheimer et al., 2007;  Sherman et al., 2009). Proponents of integrative medicine argue that patients shouldn’t be denied these needling treatments, whether the benefit comes from a placebo effect or not. However, insurers and other third-party payers generally will not provide reimbursement for drugs, devices, or medical procedures that don’t provide a specific therapeutic benefit. They would conclude that these therapies are uNPRoven. So determining whether acupuncture is superior to sham acupuncture is a key scientific question that may determine the future of this highly publicized treatment.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9456,"claim":"FDA OKs continuous blood sugar monitor without finger pricks","explanation":"This Associated Press story describes a newly FDA-approved device — a continuous glucose monitor that does not require any blood testing. The story does a great job describing the convenience and the potential for better blood sugar monitoring, and therefore, better regulation of insulin levels in people with diabetes. However, the story doesn’t evaluate the evidence for these claims. How well does the device work in real patients compared to existing systems? It’s a pretty key question that goes unanswered. More than 29 million Americans have diabetes, according the CDC. The disease requires that patients check their glucose levels throughout the day and self-administer insulin to keep those levels within a normal range. Improvements in medical technology over the past few decades have meant blood sugar monitoring and insulin delivery that is both more accurate and more convenient, helping people with diabetes maintain steadier glucose levels and have fewer crisis events. Eliminating the need for finger pricks to test one’s blood has the potential to optimize this process even more.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":12767,"claim":"And this would be the first year, if everything holds true, we will spend over $10 billion of our state budget on Medicaid out of the $28 billion budget.","explanation":"\"Rowden was trying to illustrate that Medicaid spending has reached out-of-control levels. According to Greitens' budget recommendations for fiscal year 2018, the budget for Medicaid has gone up over $1 billion in the last three years and now takes up approximately 37 percent of the state budget. Despite the growing concern from Republicans on the cost of Medicaid spending, Greitens has recommended $10.7 billion for the service for fiscal year 2018, an increase of over $500 million from fiscal year 2017. However, it’s important to note that \"\"we\"\" — as in the state of Missouri — don’t directly fund the entire $10 billion. Because of the Federal Medical Assistance Percentage and the Federal Reimbursement Allowance programs, the state only has to spend approximately $1.7 billion of state revenue on Medicaid.

{"claim_id":9032,"claim":"Vegetarian and Mediterranean diet may be equally effective in preventing heart disease","explanation":"The subject of the news release is a newly published, randomized, controlled study comparing the effects of a Mediterranean diet and a lacto-ovo vegetarian diet (which excludes meat and fish but allows eggs and dairy) on total body weight, BMI, fat mass, and cholesterol levels. The release clearly outlines the differences in the two diets and makes it clear this is the first head-to-head comparison of these two diets within groups of meat consumers. But the news release falls short in not including many of the study’s limitations, as well as making it clear to readers that the study outcomes are based on surrogate markers that cannot draw direct conclusions about “preventing heart disease” or stroke as implied. According to the CDC, heart disease is the leading cause of death in the U.S., with more than  600,000 deaths per year. Dietary patterns are known to affect our risk for heart disease, and represent an opportunity for each of us to modify that risk. What concerns most of us is having the duration or quality of our life affected by a heart attack, stroke, or other cardiovascular disease. So studies which actually look at hard outcomes like that — rather than surrogate markers such as cholesterol levels measured over just a few months — are more relevant to more people. Furthermore, studies which look at the effect of diet on major diseases like cancer, heart disease, diabetes, and stroke aren’t just widespread, but often lead to wide-ranging and wide-reaching news coverage. Such studies usually have significant limitations, debatable outcomes, and are prone to unjustified or hyperbolic language. This places a premium on journalists covering such studies to look for independent viewpoints, and a premium on readers for staying skeptical.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10958,"claim":"Study Shows Proposed Merck Drug For Diabetes Lowers Blood Sugar","explanation":"The article describes a new drug that may help improve blood sugar in people with diabetes more so than other drugs (e.g. metformin alone) or with reportedly fewer side effects. Overall, the story does address what type of evidence the claims are based on and what the reported benefits are, although context is lacking. Readers might think this is an important new medicine, when in fact, it is likely not any more effective than existing drugs currently on the market. Importantly, side effects or harms of treatment were minimized. Actual rates of low blood sugar episodes with the new drug were not reported, yet were noted to be a serious side effect of older drugs. Readers aren’t able to judge how much better the new drug may be at reducing the chance of this important side effect. The article also reports that there appear to be no serious side effects of the drug, which may be true for the moment, but caution should have been given to these findings, given that the only study was performed by the manufacturer and the study was short-term. Considering the immense health burden diabetes represents, lifestyle changes to improve blood sugar should have been mentioned as part of the treatment options.","label":"false"}

Withdrawing a drug can be a tricky business. Like with Vioxx, some people currently taking a drug may be deriving benefit from it and tolerating it fine, but others may be harmed by it. As is clear from this article, the problem isn’t that Avastin doesn’t help anybody, it’s that doctors have no accurate way to figure out who the drug will help more than harm. And when new evidence tells us that the harms can be devastating and the benefits less, on average, than we’d hoped, its use becomes more complex to justify. The real issue is with the future of drug development. The old idea was that one drug will help everyone, and if it doesn’t produce benefits on average, then it gets rejected. That model just doesn’t work in cancer any more. There is too much known about the heterogeneity of the disease, and we need to develop infrastructure to examine for whom it does work.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":10328,"claim":"Health Experts Call For Heart Checkups For Kids","explanation":"The death of a young athlete during exercise is a rare but nonetheless heartbreaking event. Some experts believe that these tragedies can be prevented by subjecting all student athletes to screening with an electrocardiogram (EKG). This story tilts strongly toward those who advocate this view and emphasizes a couple of positive anecdotes from children who benefited from an EKG. However, it provides no data demonstrating that this approach would identify more children at risk than current screening methods based on family history, personal medical history, and a thorough physical exam. Moreover, no attempt is made to balance the story with discussion of the costs and potential harms that frequent use of EKGs would entail. In the end, the story delivered a one-sided view of an issue that demanded a more nuanced treatment. A new screening program for heart abnormalities could potentially save lives but would entail significant costs and carry risks for some children. But one-sided expert arguments and supportive anecdotes do not give readers a balanced view of what is a very complicated story.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":9338,"claim":"The Scan That Saved My Life","explanation":"The story about a reporter’s decision to treat a carotid artery blockage exemplifies the powerful strengths and weaknesses of first-person health care reporting. It carries a powerful emotional punch and an apparently happy ending that overwhelms the evidence presented. Numerous psychology studies document the power of “outcome bias,” in which the results of a decision affect beliefs about whether the decision was correct or not. We are very happy that all went well, but it is reasonable to assume this story would have looked very different if had not. There is no mention of the costs of the surgical procedure. Neither is carotid stenting mentioned as an alternative to endarterectomy surgery. Discussion of carotid artery screening of people who do not have symptoms is mixed up with the reporter’s experience with testing done in order to diagnose the cause of symptoms – a somewhat common flaw of conflating diagnostic testing with screening tests. The risk that the surgery could trigger a stroke, including a fatal one, is highlighted, but the risk statistics reported here are lower than those published in major summaries of the evidence. The headline of the story proclaims that a carotid artery scan “Saved My Life.” That may be true, but it is also unknowable. What the best summaries of the evidence conclude is that in cases similar to those of the reporter, surgery to clear a nearly-blocked carotid artery lowers the long-term risk of stroke and death. However, stories on this topic should highlight the fact that the procedure does not actually “save the lives” of most patients. As a systematic review of the evidence by the Cochrane Collaboration concluded, using a statistical analysis known as the number needed to treat (NNT), six patients need to be treated to prevent one stroke or death within five years of the surgery. That means that for five out of six patients, the procedure probably does not alter the outcome: Either they would not have had a stroke or died even without surgery or they still had a stroke or died despite having the surgery. Another important concern with this story is that the reporter uses his own case — where the scan was part of an attempt to track down the cause of his neurological symptoms — to argue for scanning of all older adults, including those who have no symptoms at all. This is a misleading argument since people with blockage severe enough to cause symptoms are likely different in important ways (and more likely to benefit from this scan) than those who don’t display symptoms. While it is certainly reasonable to choose a treatment shown to reduce the risk of stroke and death, it is imperative that stories clearly communicate the difference between screening and diagnosis, and the uncertainty about whether any particular patient will benefit.","label":"false"}

The story wades into discussions of sexual orientation and even at what age an individual knows this truth about him or herself. These difficult topics are germane to the epidemiology of the many human papillomaviruses, and which people of both sexes are at highest risk from infection. Bravo for reading the editorial that accompanied the study article, and chasing down its author on deadline to get her comments. Bravo for asking “why” when confronted with the seemingly contradictory news that Gardasil can prevent genital warts but is not recommended by the CDC for universal prevention in young men. Since Gardasil (and competitor, Cervarix) debuted a few years ago, there have been heated disagreements about the price and most helpful distribution of the vaccines and whether both sexes should receive them. This major study, demonstrating effectiveness in young men, adds important information to complex questions of cost and prevention. But it needs to be reported in a way that provides some of the history and context for readers. HPV infection is transmitted sexually, so questions of prevention within the entire US population of men and women involve potentially vaccinating both sexes. However, both sexes are not at the same level of risk for potentially deadly cancers years later. Women bear the brunt of the health risks, but men can pass the infection to their partners and can suffer from cancerous and non-cancerous effects of the virus. This new study provides additional information for the ongoing discussion about the public health role of immunizing young men against HPV.","label":"MISLEADING"}

And limited by the endorsement of just one patient, the article fails to quantify the benefits of the operation in a large population of people suffering with similar problems. Is this patient’s experience typical? What do cohort studies show? Are there other treatments that might help? (See “Treatment Options” above.) Are there randomized trials comparing ankle replacement to other treatments? Is there high-quality evidence to suggest any intervention provides a satisfactory outcome over the long run? Regrettably, these questions remain unanswered. The implication of stories such as this is that when there is nothing to lose, people should be willing to subject themselves to the potential harms of something new.

Study says it’s possible","explanation":"\"Allergies to common food stuffs, that elicit severe reaction can be life threatening and are a serious problem. This story presented some very preliminary results that suggest a means of making these situations more manageable for the affected individual. The story, while generally fairly complete in its description of the research, was a bit imbalanced in its assessment of the effectiveness and applicability of the treatment described. Letting the lead researcher get away with saying that there would be a treatment for kids with food allergy in 5 years is complete conjecture and may offer false hope for a timetable. From the results available at this time, it is not clear whether this treatment will be beneficial to individuals older than pre-school, whether its effectiveness might diminish over time or whether there are some undesireable side effects that might accompany this treatment. The story did provide ample caveats about the small, pilot nature of the studies and the fact that larger, randomized studies were needed to improve the evidence. But including the prediction from the lead researcher and the quote from the parent of a child in the study –  \"\"Our whole worry level is really gone.\"\" – introduces an imbalance that is not backed up by evidence at this time. This is very preliminary research, done in small numbers of children. That should be an important take-home message for consumers.\"","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":10916,"claim":"New morning-after pill works for up to 5 days","explanation":"In 1999, the FDA first approved the prescription-only Plan B (two high dose pills of Levonorgestrel, a hormone commonly found in many birth control pills). In 2006, Plan B was made available without a prescription to women over the age of 18, however this ruling remains controversial and it is currently only available over-the-counter in 9 states (http:\/\/www.pharmacyaccess.org). EllaOne, a new drug currently only available in Europe, may be more effective at preventinging pregnancy than Levonorgestrel even when taken several days after uNPRotected sex or contraceptive failure. In a study published in the current issue of Lancet, women who took ellaOne within five days had a lower chance of pregnancy than those who took Levonorgestrel. In the study 1.8% got pregnant after taking ellaOne compared to 2.6% with Levonorgestrel. This story quotes two independent health experts who provide very valuable and balanced perspectives on the new study. The story could have been improved by describing the costs of the new drug compared to Levonorgestrel. Although the story mentions that ellaOne could cost up to three times as much as Levonorgestrel, this is not adequate information on costs. Most importantly, however, the story does the reader a disservice by not describing the harms and side effects of either option. In the study 19% experienced headaches and other common side effects include abdominal pain, nausea\/vomiting, and cramps. In short, taking these pills is not a pleasant experience but nonetheless is far safer than abortion.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":10534,"claim":"Gastric Bypass May Help Obese Teens","explanation":"\"The content of this television segment is generally accurate. A small study suggests that obese, diabetic teens can benefit significantly from gastric bypass surgery. It correctly says that this is an important finding for a condition that is serious and very hard to treat. It also indicates the surgery is controversial and its long-term effects unknown. But the story’s tone is excessively positive in a way the facts do not allow. The study’s flaws and limitations should have made the report more circumspect and restrained. The surgery group was very small, extremely obese and not well-matched to the controls. The study was retrospective and as a result fails to capture some key data. In addition, the surgery has serious side-effects that were not reported. The lack of data on long-term risks and benefits is mentioned as a small caveat, rather than a major gap in the research that leaves the most fundamental questions unanswered. The story’s most serious technical shortcoming is a failure to quantify the findings, which would have allowed people to appreciate how few teens were involved yet how many of them benefited. It would also have shown viewers how unusually obese the studied population was. The story illustrates how journalists may use unnecessarily loaded language to overdramatize findings. The segment uses the following words:     * dramatic (2)    * drastic    * radical    * remarkable    * huge    * dire    * life-threatening    * reversed    * disappeared    * vanished While some of these words may be accurate in context, the cumulative effect is to heighten hope and fear beyond what the facts permit. This is often found in television reports, where the need to \"\"sell\"\" the story both to get it on the air and to engage viewers second-by-second drives writers and producers to hyperbole. If findings are significant enough to justify air time, they do not need to be oversold. If they need to be oversold, they do not belong on the air.\"","label":"false"}

You bet. Are there other experts who warn against undergoing tests that may promise more than they deliver? Yup. Is pitting one expert against the other going to show readers who is right? Not likely, based on this point-counterpoint debate over coronary artery calcium screening. This story demonstrates the pitfalls of presenting scientific issues as though they were political debates. This sort of “equal time” treatment gives the impression that there is equal evidence backing each side. Failing to give readers appropriate context makes the sparring claims almost impossible to judge. Allowing two experts to advocate their points of view is better than presenting just one side of a contentious matter, but in this case, the lack of context and explanation is likely to leave readers feeling bewildered and helpless. Screening has a natural appeal. After all, who wouldn’t want to have a health crisis prevented, rather than treated after the fact? However, determining the balance between potential benefits (Does a test actually help people prevent an illness or death?) and potential harms (Does the test expose people to costs and side effects of testing and treatment?) is complex and individual. News stories should attempt to clarify how people can interpret the available evidence so that it applies to their own situation.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9650,"claim":"Teen Feels 'Hopeful' After Experimental Stem Cell Procedure on Damaged Heart","explanation":"This is a story about one young man receiving an experimental infusion of stem cells into his heart, to help with tissue scarring due to muscular dystrophy. Despite booming research around potential stem cell treatments for a wide range of conditions, the list of diseases for which stem cell therapy has been shown to be effective remains very short, according to the International Society for Stem Cell Research. Yet media outlets often put an optimistic spin on unproven stem cell therapies, as we’ve seen in our examinations of stories on heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, severe combined immunodeficiency, and multiple sclerosis. Showcasing a few preliminary cases with encouraging outcomes can exaggerate the potential benefits of a treatment and raise false hopes for patients. This story, based on a single case with an unknown outcome, fits this pattern. It fails to counter rosy statements by a physician and a patient with realistic assessments of the potential benefits and pitfalls of an unproven procedure for a fatal disease with no known cure. The story also lacks clinical details that would help readers get a true picture of the nature of the treatment, as well as a discussion of costs. Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a heartbreaking disease that affects an estimated 1 in 3,600 boys as well as some girls. The most common inherited pediatric muscle disorder, it’s caused by a shortage of a protein called dystrophin, which leads to progressive muscle weakness. Most patients lose their ability to walk by age 12, and average life expectancy is about 25. Often patients die of heart failure because dystrophin deficiency leads to cardiomyopathy, a weakness of the heart muscle that makes the heart less able to pump blood and maintain a regular rhythm. A recent review of current therapies states that “only steroids have been shown to produce a slowing in the declining course of the disease.” Recent research has focused on using stem cells and gene therapy to create new, healthy muscle cells and thus halt or reverse the disease. The rapid advance and certain fatality of Duchenne muscular dystrophy has patients and their families desperate for new treatment options. Reporters have an obligation to those families to present stories in a reasonable and responsible fashion.","label":"false"}

It reports on a meta-analysis of more than 100 studies comparing either drug with a placebo or with each other and finds that both types of medications are equally effective. The only difference being that ARBs tend to produce fewer cases of dry cough as a side effect than do ACE inhibitors. This story is shorter and less nuanced than a competing Washington Post piece, and it relies excessively on a New York University news release. There is more information about the underlying mechanism of these drugs, something probably of less interest to readers, but less about what is new about this study and why it may be important. The story never clarifies what outcomes we’re talking about with this research — blood pressure, heart attacks, deaths? In addition, the emphasis on the finding of better tolerability does not discuss why this may be – there’s no mention of the greater likelihood of cough and angioedema with ACEIs. Finally, the statement about cost may be somewhat misleading. This story, and another by the Washington Post covering the same study, offer new information concerning a debate over the treatment of choice for cardiovascular patients and those at high risk for the disease. Earlier studies had favored the use of ACE inhibitors of ARBs but this new analysis suggests they are comparably effective. If that is the case, it gives patient populations and their physicians additional choices when determining the most effective treatment plan.","label":"MISLEADING"}

The drug is thought to target amyloid — protein fragments that aggregate abnormally in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s. But the dense technical language of the release prevents most readers from understanding the scale of the improvement reported in patient thinking or behavior during this study. The major drawback of the release is that it didn’t talk about limitations of the sub-group analysis. While exploratory, this sub-group analysis cannot lead one to draw any conclusions about whether the drug “worked,” given that the overall study was negative. The release also did not help readers understand when the drug would be prescribed, in relation to diagnosis, if the drug is approved. Estimates are that more than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive and disabling neurological disorder. This release about a drug that might slow decline or ease symptoms is disappointing. It claims the drug works, but doesn’t make it clear for readers just how well. We aren’t given context for understanding the numbers that are shared.

{"claim_id":11035,"claim":"Doubts on mammogram software","explanation":"This story provides readers with a balanced discussion of the potential downside of incorporating newer technologies into routine practice too soon. Specifically, the story reports evidence recently published in the New England Journal of Medicine that computer-aided detection (CAD), a newer method of reading mammographies, was no better–and may have produced more false positives–than images read and interpreted by radiologists alone. There was 20% increase in biopsies after mammographers used the CAD software, and many of these women had non-malignant lesions. The article did not adequately describe the study. It was an observational study of select practices in the US – not randomized, not controlled and there was no information about how representative these samples were, especially in the centers that used CAD. The story reported on key results, but without adequately explaining how they were arrived at. The story provides multiple perspectives on the CAD technology in breast cancer detection. The reporter interviews not only the lead author of the NEJM study, but also the author of an accompanying editorial on this newer technology, as well as radiologists who talk about CAD in their practice. Interviews with clinicians who offer a rationale for not using the CAD technology give excellent balance to the story and provide an often overlooked perspective: newer and more high-tech devices are not necessarily better. The story notes the additional $20 per mammogram cost to Medicare with CAD. With the newer technology, costs to public health would increase via additional screening and unnecessary biopsies, and treatment would likely increase for cancers that may never become problematic (i.e. some forms of DCIS or ductal carcinoma in situ). Importantly, the story discuses the continued benefit of mammography for early detection of breast cancer. The story highlights that computer-assisted screening does not replace human judgment in interpretation of radiological films. More screening centers with the CAD technology are available; however, the new technology may not serve women any better. Traditional mammography with a radiologist interpreting the results may be more accurate and result in fewer unnecessary tests and biopsies.","label":"true"}
{"claim_id":9779,"claim":"Bacteria From Mother May Colonize Cesarean Births","explanation":"This is a well-articulated but incomplete story about a proof-of-principle study suggesting that when babies born by C-section are swabbed with their mother’s vaginal fluids, they have a microbiome more closely approximating those of their vaginally-born peers up to a month after birth. The article does a nice job of explaining the science and placing the evidence in context, but we think that it missed the mark on the potential harms of the intervention. This is a significant omission. Emerging research suggests that the types and patterns of natural bacteria growing on our bodies are important for healthy immune, digestive, and metabolic systems. Babies born by C-section do not have the benefit of being colonized by the natural bacteria in their mothers’ vaginal tracts, so an alternative method for inoculating babies with these bacteria (and an inexpensive, easy-to-implement one, at that) may even the playing field for C-section babies.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":11504,"claim":"Mother’s blood test reveals baby’s sex","explanation":"Reuters reports on a new survey, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, which reinforces the accuracy of a certain blood test for determining the sex of a fetus as early as seven weeks along in pregnancy. We like how the Reuters story clearly discusses the numbers from the JAMA study, and points out that – while accurate – this kind of blood test could still lead to false information for some parents. But we find the New York Times story gives more consumer information for US audiences, explaining that “the tests have been available to consumers in drugstores and online for a few years.”  Earlier sex-determination in pregnancy could lead to parents choosing (or trying to choose) the gender they prefer. Internationally, it is already clear that some parents in China and India are deliberately choosing male babies, and aborting female fetuses. The research reported in these two stories, a survey in the Journal of the American Medical Association, does not directly address these larger ethical implications. But the study’s lead author, Diana Bianchi, does stress that she wants to examine “why people are buying these things” and the consequences of consumer access to over-the-counter testing for fetal gender.","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":9094,"claim":"Arthrokinex Announces IRAPjoint Product, a Non-Drug, Non-Surgical Joint Pain Management Solution Made From Your Own Blood.","explanation":"This news release heralds the creation of a new treatment for osteoarthritis (OA) patients and those with joint pain. The therapy, called IRAPjoint, consists of withdrawing a patient’s blood, heating it, and then re-injecting it into the painful joint. The theory behind this practice, which has been done for several years in Europe, is that heat increases the number of anti-inflammatory proteins (also called anti-inflammatory cytokines) in the blood, which then combat inflammation at the re-injection site. While increasingly popular with professional athletes (and horses), there is little actual scientific evidence that this treatment works. Anecdotal evidence can be important, and for top athletes whose careers depend on healthy joints, the gamble and steep price tag may be worth it. But for the general public, there is no high-quality scientific literature that shows this as a credible alternative to existing OA treatments. Joint pain can be caused by different conditions. Though not explicitly mentioned in this news release, the treatment discussed, IRAPjoint, is targeted to individuals with joint inflammation due to arthritic disease. This may be due to overuse (such as professional athletes and “weekend warriors”) or simply wear and tear due to aging. Osteoarthritis (OA) affects millions of Americans, and is the most common chronic joint condition. It can be especially debilitating in older patients, many of whom experience constant pain and loss of mobility. A safe, effective treatment that doesn’t involve the use of harsh steroids or constant pain medications would be welcome and improve the quality of life for many. But the release is not clear about just who should get this treatment. It  provides almost no information on the data to support this product and in whom it should be used (other than professional athletes).","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":11572,"claim":"Less Frequent Mammograms May Lower False-Positive Results","explanation":"The first sentence mentions “A slightly higher risk of being diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer” but two lines later we’re told this “wasn’t statistically significant.”  So why was it in the lead? And why state it as a definitively “slightly higher risk”? The story converts 61% (false positives from annual screening) into “more than half” but then gives the actual percentage – 42%  who had false positives from biennial screening. “More than half” could be 51% or higher. That was too vague and unhelpful. The story frames this “as the latest volley in an ongoing debate.”  Not really. This was science at work – a new study published in a journal. The story says the US Preventive Services Task Force 2009 mammography recommendations “startled the world.”  Not really. It didn’t startle anyone who follows this science closely. The framing of this story was odd and troubling. Rather than build in drama (“latest volley…startled the world”), journalists would be better off giving the data and getting out of the way with flowery phrases. The critical question is whether you can do less frequent screening, subject women to fewer harms and get similar results in terms of detection of “early stage” cancer.

{"claim_id":17953,"claim":"We've seen priests beheaded by the Islamic rebels on the other side. We've also seen an Islamic rebel eating the heart of a soldier.","explanation":"Paul said Islamic rebels have decapitated priests, and one was seen eating the heart of a Syrian soldier. News reports show that Islamic rebels gunned down a priest but did not behead him. The murder of a priest speaks to religious warfare and that carries great weight. However, thousands of innocent people have died from gunfire in this civil war. The claim is evocative in part due to the beheading, and that aspect is plainly inaccurate. In addition, the truth has been widely available for two months and Paul had ample opportunity to know better. Paul’s claim about a rebel eating a heart is more accurate, but the details are sketchy. Both the focus on a heart and the idea of cannibalism push strong emotional buttons. But it might not have been a heart, and there might not have been an actual bite. Still, a rebel carved up a dead Syrian soldier, boasted about it as he did so, and at the very least, spoke and acted as though he were eating the dead man’s liver and heart. The first statement is flawed, and the second is largely on the mark with some weak points.

{"claim_id":8981,"claim":"Stem Cells Shows Promise For Repairing Torn Meniscus","explanation":"This news release describes the results of an experiment using stem cells and other blood components derived from fat tissue to repair a torn meniscus. The release relies on general statements regarding the degree of benefits or harms to the patient and ignores the issue of costs entirely. It doesn’t adequately explain the research. It suggests that the approach described is readily available, although it is not. Both the release and the published report are based on a single patient case, not a clinical trial (or even a case series). As such, the data supporting the release are very limited. Injuries to the meniscus are common among Americans and the routine approach to fixing them involves surgery. If a new method could avoid an invasive approach, that would be a boon to public health. But this new approach requires sophisticated cellular separation techniques which are not cheap. And touting the results of one experiment on a single patient followed for barely a year is clearly premature.","label":"false"}

An abstract of the study was presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Anesthesiologists. The story did a good job of reporting on the cost and availability of this procedure. However, it didn’t acknowledge that the study’s findings are unreliable because there was no comparison with a control arm of patients who didn’t get the device. The story also played up an unsupported claim that this therapy could reduce opioid use and didn’t disclose that one source has significant conflicts of interest. Back pain is common and aggravating, and patients are often willing to try anything for relief. News stories should offer plenty of cautions about potential treatments that don’t have solid evidence of a benefit, particularly if they are risky and invasive procedures. Moreover, journalists should flag conflicted doctors who make money off of implanting devices and resist the temptation to report unsubstantiated claims that an intervention can reduce opioid use.","label":"MISLEADING"}

That moderate alcohol consumption reduces heart disease risk is not a new idea, however recommending it in individuals with high blood pressure is controversial given that excessive alcohol can actually raise blood pressure. This study supports the idea that moderate amounts of alcohol can be just as beneficial to men with hypertenstion as it is for those who do not have high blood pressure. The story adequately describes the strength of the existing evidence and points out some of the limitations, for example, that the results may not be generalizable to a broader population. However, the story should have also mentioned that any study using self-reported intake of food or drink is always prone to error in how consumption is measured. The story does not quantify the benefits of moderate drinking. The story only provided qualitative descriptions of the benefits. Furthermore, the story does not mention any alternatives to reduce cardiovascular disease risk. Finally, the story only quotes one expert, the lead author on the study. The story should have quoted multiple experts who could provide more perspective. This \"\"brief\"\" is clearly designed to be so; an editorial decision by the Globe.

{"claim_id":9346,"claim":"KETAMINE SHOWS PROMISE AS TREATMENT FOR ADOLESCENTS WITH DEPRESSION","explanation":"This story reported on a preliminary study looking at whether the drug ketamine might be a potential treatment for adolescent depression. The story refrained from disease-mongering and quantified the scope of the observed benefits. However, the headline and lead were misleading in stating that teens who took the drug had improvements in their depression. The word “promise” used in the headline wasn’t borne out by the data. In fact, the study wasn’t designed to offer reliable evidence that the drug offers a benefit. Caveats about the study were included only toward the end of the story, and readers were left in the dark about ketamine’s potential for misuse and its potential side effects. Costs were also missing. Adolescent depression is a widespread problem, and a substantial number of adolescents don’t respond successfully to drugs that are currently available. Given high public interest in an effective alternative, news reports should refrain from encouraging false hopes when it comes to early-stage research. That means emphasizing appropriate caveats with the quality of evidence and refraining from making claims that aren’t borne out by the data.

{"claim_id":9592,"claim":"Kids With Anxiety Disorders ‘Significantly’ Benefit From Mindfulness Exercises By Changing Brain Activity","explanation":"The story addresses the use of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy as a means of treating anxiety disorders in children, focusing on a recent study of nine children who had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and who had a parent with bipolar disorder. The story reports that the study found cognitive therapy was effective at reducing anxiety in study participants. The story does a good job of highlighting that these findings are preliminary, and that additional research is needed to determine how effective cognitive therapy may be as a treatment option for the general population. However, the story does not discuss the extent of the therapy’s benefits in this study, the availability and cost of such cognitive therapy for children, or whether the study participants were also being treated with medications while undergoing cognitive therapy. The story also appears to draw heavily on a news release, and does not incorporate input from independent experts. Anxiety disorders are not uncommon in children. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately 25 percent of 13-18 year olds will experience an anxiety disorder — and approximately 6 percent of 13-18 year olds will experience a severe anxiety disorder. These disorders may include obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and phobias, among others. A 2010 paper published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine Journal notes that pediatric anxiety disorders can cause “considerable functional impairment,” impose significant economic costs, adversely affect a child’s education, and increase a child’s risk for adult psychiatric disorders. In other words, pediatric anxiety disorders affect a great many people and can have long-term consequences for both children and their families. Research on new treatment options that can ameliorate the effects of anxiety disorders in children is well worth covering. However, as always, it is important to note both the limitations of new research, and the extent to which potential patients will have access to any treatment options being discussed. A more fundamental question may be: what’s new here? This isn’t the first study to address mindfulness-based cognitive therapy for treating either children or anxiety disorders.","label":"false"}

To the casual reader, one might think that there’s a story here. But that’s what makes the lack of information so problematic. One can almost see the headlines: “Have a concussion? Look at life through rose-colored glasses.” With no proof in this release, reporters and readers can be misled into thinking that these findings are a bigger deal than they really are. Photophobia, or sensitivity to light, is a common symptom in the days or weeks following a traumatic brain injury. If the study results hold up in larger trials, wearing colored glasses instead of dark sunglasses indoors to reduce headaches could be a useful solution for this temporary condition.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10815,"claim":"Magnet device aims to treat depression patients","explanation":"\"For people suffering from severe depression who have not responded to medical treatment, the idea that a non-invasive procedure is now available is welcome news. On October 8, 2008, the FDA announced that they had cleared transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, for patients who had not responded to antidepressant therapy. However, because TMS is not an implantable device, the FDA was merely required to clear the device on the basis that it was \"\"safe and equivalent\"\" to electro-shock therapy. The ruling does not claim that TMS is effective, and many questions remain about just how much benefit TMS provides compared to existing treatments. This story does not exaggerate the seriousness or prevalence of depression and thereby avoids disease mongering. The story is also clear to point out that the FDA approval is specifically for people who have failed first-line treatment with medication. The story could have done more to explain that TMS is not for people who have mild depression or who have not attempted other forms of treatment first. The story does a good job of describing the costs of TMS, which are significantly higher than medication, and of describing the novelty of TMS. Although TMS itself is not new, it has only recently been studied as a possible treatment, rather than just a research tool. The story does provide some quantification of benefits of TMS, describing what percentage of subjects scored significantly better on standard depression scores after treatment with TMS compared to sham. However, it was not clear from the story what \"\"significantly better\"\" meant and if that translates into real clinical differences for the patient. The story mentions antidepressants and shock therapy but does not mention other very effective treatments for depression, including psychotherapy, either in combination with medication or by itself, and self-help techniques. Nor does the story explain that there are many different antidepressants and if a patient does not respond to one drug, other drugs can be tried before resorting to TMS. In addition, the story misrepresents shock therapy as a \"\"last resort\"\" treatment. While shock therapy isn’t the first choice for many people, it could be a reasonable choice in certain clinical situation. Describing shock therapy in this way may be harmful to patients and families who are considering shock therapy at a time when it is likely to help. Furthermore, while the story describes the study and points out that the FDA had many concerns about it, the story does not describe what those concerns were. The story does explain that a new study should provide better data, but does not mention that this approval comes after a prior panel found insufficient evidence to support TMS. That the story focused only on the current study and FDA decision without putting it into context of the whole body of literature on the subject is problematic. Also, the story mentions that TMS was recently approved. However, the story should have emphasized that it is still considered experimental in spite of the approval and its availability is limited to a few research centers. Finally, the story quotes two experts who are both involved in the research on TMS in depression. The story should have quoted additional experts who do not have a stake in the outcome to provide some much needed balance. The story did not explicitly address whether the researchers had any financial conflict of interest.\"","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9195,"claim":"Laparoscopic anti-reflux operation for GERD linked to fewer postoperative complications","explanation":"A new study by the American College of Surgeons, a professional organization, compared records for 75,000 patients who underwent surgery for GERD, or gastrointestinal esophageal reflux disease. The study looked at two different surgical procedures and found the less invasive one seemed equally effective, but kept patients in the hospital a shorter time with fewer complications. The news release did a good job of discussing surgical alternatives and costs, which were estimated to be $9,000 lower for the less invasive laparoscopic procedure. The release would have been better had it spelled out some of the study limitations, the key one being that a retrospective, observational review of hospital records — as this study was — isn’t capable of supporting the cause and effect statements sprinkled throughout the release. Millions of Americans complain of occasional heartburn, sometimes called a burning sensation in the throat from food coming back up from the stomach. But some estimates are that about 20 percent of US adults fit the definition of GERD, which means they suffer symptoms at least every week. If patients consider a surgical fix, this study shows that a less-invasive procedure could reduce their complications and shorten their hospital stay. It’s hard to pin down stats on GERD prevalence. A 2014 review of 16 epidemiological studies of GERD prevalence published in the journal Gut suggest GERD prevalence ranges from “18.1%-27.8% in North America, 8.8%-25.9% in Europe, 2.5%-7.8% in East Asia, 8.7%-33.1% in the Middle East, 11.6% in Australia and 23.0% in South America.”","label":"true"}

{"claim_id":9461,"claim":"HOW TO LOSE WEIGHT: TWO-WEEK DIET BETTER FOR DROPPING POUNDS","explanation":"This article describes a small and limited study (men only!) concluding that “intermittent” dieting that gives participants alternating cycles of two weeks of less restrictive weight-maintenance eating after two weeks of more restrictive calorie counts results in more weight loss over time. The article properly notes the potential benefits of such a plan–better compliance and some possible metabolic assist that prevents dieting “plateaus” that frustrate so many trying to lose pounds. But while the article acknowledges the flaws in most trendy diets, it doesn’t offer readers enough specific information to determine whether this variation on the dietary theme will work for them any better than any other diet. For example, it doesn’t say what the two arms of the intermittent diet included in actual calorie counts and\/or foods; what the starting and ending average weights were for the study group; or even how the researchers kept track of what the participants were actually eating or doing other than (presumably) weighing them every two weeks. It’s hard to exaggerate the confusion, frustration, misinformation, disinformation, and potential harm perpetrated by the gazillion diets proffered by those with and without any scientific basis to the growing numbers of obese and overweight in the U.S. and worldwide. Indeed, this Newsweek article starts out with just that notion, but can’t resist promoting yet another one based on very limited evidence and information.

{"claim_id":10647,"claim":"Aspirin’s heart benefits vary","explanation":"This piece presents relative benefits of aspirin for men and women without providing similar context of the risks from daily aspirin use. And the piece provides no absolute figures – only relative. So, for example, it says that “in women, aspirin reduces the rate of stroke blood clots in the brain, the most common type, by 24 percent….in men the daily aspirin cuts heart attack risk by 32 percent.” But 24 percent of what? And 32 percent of what? The journal article upon which the story is based did state the absolute values for both benefits and risks. Those absolute values show that, over about a six and half year period, daily aspirin is predicted to result in 2 fewer strokes and 2.5 more major bleeds per 1000 women; and 8 fewer heart attacks and 3 more major bleeds per 1000 men. To many viewers, those numbers will mean more than 32% or 24%. This meta-analysis of retrospective studies did find that aspirin had different beneficial cardiovascular effects for men and women, and aspirin use was associated with significant bleeding risk for both men and women. When reporting on therapeutic claims, journalists should present the chances for benefit and for harm, and it should be presented in absolute terms, not just in relative terms.","label":"MISLEADING"}

But read our full review for our questions about how the story covered (or didn’t cover) the evidence, benefits and cost issues at play. The path to approval of an investigational drug usually has many twists and turns. Brilinta is no exception. The pivotal trial for this platelet inhibitor was completed and based on the positive findings, the advisory board that reviewed the data voted to recommend approval. But there was an interesting sidebar. Brilinta did not work as well in preventing events in people with acute coronary syndrome as did a potential competitor, Plavix in the United States sites for the trial. Astra Zeneca wanted to know why. This latest report is a follow up examination of the original trial and the authors concluded that Brilinta and low dose aspirin worked a bit better that Plavix and aspirin.

{"claim_id":9511,"claim":"Roche's Pricey New Breast-Cancer Combo Barely Beats Old Drug","explanation":"The latest result on Roche’s new combo therapy for breast cancer occurs as a disappointment to investors, though it is one that’s unsurprising to medical researchers. This Bloomberg article receives high marks for reporting the cost, harms and perhaps negligible benefit of the new treatment which combines a newer drug (Perjeta) with an older drug (Herceptin). The story is balanced with its inclusion of the more optimistic side of the news. Roche plans to track the new therapy for years to come to determine if the currently observed small improvement will accentuate over time. This is a notable endeavor since the long-term effect and safety of a cancer treatment is nearly as important as its immediate potency. For more of our analysis on how the news media covered the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting where this drug combo and other new research was showcased, see: High drug costs (and stock values) take center stage at final day of ASCO Small studies get big headlines at ASCO 2017 6 things to keep in mind if you read cancer-related news in the next few days   The article suggests that though Herceptin has been a potent treatment for women with aggressive HER2-positive breast cancer for decades, apparently one in four women will eventually relapse.

{"claim_id":11627,"claim":"Studies show that for kids’ ear infections, antibiotics work better than waiting","explanation":"Overall, we reviewed four pieces on this study. All the others (CNN, LA Times, NPR) got four star reviews. We appreciate that journalists sometimes want to bring their own perspective to a story, and we think this can provide valuable context when the reporter approaches the issue carefully. In this blog post about the use of antibiotics to treat children’s ear infections, however, the writer prioritizes her own experience and conclusions while ignoring important evidence and failing to seek out the perspective of any real expert. And so the story provides a lopsided and overly simplified account of an issue that demands more balanced coverage and careful consideration of benefits and harms. Read the CNN blog post for what we think is a fair comparison – blog to blog, head to head. This blog piece suggests that antibiotics are more effective than placebos for treating middle ear infections in infants and toddlers — a conclusion supported by two new randomized controlled trials reported in the respected New England Journal of Medicine. While useful to know, this information isn’t enough to tell us how all children with ear infections should be treated. To make these kinds of treatment choices, it’s also important to consider how much more effective antibiotics are than no treatment, and we should be aware that the benefits might depend on how confident the doctor is in the diagnosis (viral colds and other problems often look like ear infections, but won’t benefit from treatment). We also need to weigh the downsides of treatment, which include adverse effects such as diarrhea as well as the potential for increased risk of future infections with antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. After considering all of these factors, different parents may come to different decisions about whether they want to treat their child immediately with an antiobiotic or reserve treatment for a brief period while waiting to see if he gets better on his own. Reporters don’t do parents any favors when they encourage them to make knee jerk decisions about a child’s care, as this blog did.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10071,"claim":"Shots more effective than FluMist in adults","explanation":"First, we acknowledge that the version of the AP story that we found in the Charlotte Observer was less than half the length (327 words) of the AP story as we found it in other newspapers (734 words). So the reporter clearly did a lot more work than what was seen in the Charlotte paper. This is a troubling practice that we've written about elsewhere on the site. Nonetheless, the article accurately summarizes the availability of flu vaccines and the primary results of the new study in the New England Journal of Medicine — the proportion of children protected from the flu by each of two tested vaccines (i.e. the vaccines’ absolute efficacy). However, the story could provide more information to help readers judge the meaning of these results, the novelty of the “new” live, inhaled vaccine, its potential harms and costs, the overall quality of the research, potential conflicts among the story’s sources, and other health measures readers can take to prevent the flu. The AP report omits mention of costs—a significant feature of any major public health initiative. It’s unfortunate that the article fails to put the data on vaccine efficacy into a meaningful context. To begin with, the advantage of the killed vaccine shots over the live FluMist vaccine was not statistically significant. But the fact the shots were just as good as the inhaled vaccine was surprising. The researchers note that the main virus they were concerned about (type A) had changed or “drifted” from the strain that was in the vaccine. Earlier studies had led them to expect that the inactivated vaccine shots would be less effective in this situation. Instead, the shots and nasal spraywere very effective (74% each, according to the new study). The killed virus was also very effective against two strains of type B virus. More information on potential harms might also allay fears associated with live vaccines. Side effects described in the New England Journal of Medicine study were mostly minor–runny nose, headache, cough, and muscle aches among those receiving the live nasal spray vaccine and sore arms among those receiving the shots. The study authors attributed one serious complication to the live (nasal) vaccine—acute pericarditis, or inflammation around the heart and major vessels—a problem that required hospitalization. A little more information about the story’s sources would also help readers assess the new research. The story (as it appeared in the Charlotte paper) quotes a single university-based vaccine expert, but does not state whether he has any potential conflicts of interest. The story fails to note that two researchers received consulting fees from pharmaceutical companies–including MedImmune, which manufactures the FluMist inhaled vaccine in partnership with the researchers’ employer, the University of Michigan. Finally, the AP report misses an opportunity to explain other measures people can take to prevent the flu. In addition to vaccination, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend several (http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/flu\/protect\/habits.htm). These include using antiviral drugs and good health habits (e.g. avoid close contact; stay home when sick, cover your mouth and nose; clean your hands; avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth). It would be unfortunate if readers took away the message that flu prevention is not very effective or that a shot (or snort) has little value for the healthier members of a flu-prone community. What did the reporter put in the longer version of his story that you didn't read in the Charlotte paper? Quotes from two other physician-researchers. Caveats about interpreting the study results. Information from another flu study that appeared in the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Information from an editorial in that journal. Information on the age groups approved for use of FluMist. Information on the number of flu deaths (36,000) and hospitalizations (200,000\/yr.) from the flu. In other words, you missed a lot. So this is more of a review of the editing done by the Charlotte newspaper that picked up the story off the wire than it is of the work of the original AP reporter.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9088,"claim":"Sleep deprivation is an effective anti-depressant for nearly half of depressed patients","explanation":"This release summarizes a meta-analysis of 66 studies on sleep deprivation as a therapy for depression that suggests deprivation had an antidepressant effect roughly half the time. The sleep deprivation varied in length and the precise way it was provided to patients. Partial sleep deprivation, or sleeping for three to four hours, followed by forced wakefulness for 20 to 21 hours appeared equally as effective as total sleep deprivation (being deprived of sleep for 36 hours). The release says that the analysis provided very helpful details on effectiveness in “many populations” but it does not give us any examples of the populations grouped by gender, age or ethnicity that were studied. Most importantly, it doesn’t note that measured benefits were extremely short-term in most patient volunteers who found their gains were reversed after the next full night’s sleep. This key finding wasn’t missed in a Philadelphia Inquirer story on the same study which we also reviewed. Depression is a major cause of disability in the US and around the world, with estimates that 16.1 million adults in the US had an episode in 2015, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. The most common treatment for depression are anti-depressant drugs which don’t work for everyone and carry many side effects. If sleep deprivation was a practical solution for more patients it could relieve suffering and disability. But is it practical? It’s counter-intuitive that sleep deprivation can act as a clinical treatment for depression. After all, a hallmark of depression is the inability to sleep. Conversely, many patients with depression start to feel better for the long term when they can start getting a good night’s sleep. It’s also important to note that forced sleep deprivation is known to affect mental and physical health. In the published study, authors noted that the benefit of sleep deprivation is “transient in most individuals and reversed following a subsequent night of sleep.” This does not seem like a durable treatment. More research is needed, as the authors say in the release.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":9224,"claim":"Dabigatran superior to warfarin when anticoagulation is resumed after bleeding","explanation":"This news release touts an analysis of Medicare data for 1,500 patients who suffered a major bleeding event while taking anticoagulants for atrial fibrillation. Researchers found that patients who resumed anticoagulants after a hemorrhage had better stroke and mortality rates than those who did not, and those who resumed treatment with a newer drug, dabigatran, had fewer recurrent hemorrhages than those who restarted treatment with the old standby warfarin. The news release lays out relative differences in outcomes but doesn’t include absolute risks and benefits that would convey the true significance of these findings. Nor does it mention the wide cost difference between the two drugs or the fact that prescribing patterns at the time the data were collected may have skewed the findings. Bottom line: this is an observational study, not a controlled clinical trial. It is not appropriate to be making recommendations about one drug or another based on such a study. This study sheds light on the dilemma of whether patients at risk for blood clots should resume taking anticoagulants after a major hemorrhage. Less than half of patients who survived a bleeding incident resumed taking anticoagulant drugs, apparently because their doctors perceived a high risk of recurrent bleeding. But the authors say their finding that the risk of stroke outweighs the risk of recurrent bleeding should encourage clinicians to resume anti-clotting drugs. And while the analysis shows better outcomes with a new drug compared with an old one, the authors acknowledge that finding needs to be validated in other patient groups and with more recent data. In an observational study such as this, one must be very cautious with the conclusions.","label":"false"}

The study was based on data from 280,000 Medicare patients who underwent coronary angioplasty, also called percutaneous coronary interventions or PCI, to alleviate chest pain or shortness of breath. PCI involves using a balloon to open up clogged arteries and restore blood flow to the heart. Cardiologists frequently use the femoral artery in the groin as the access point when performing a PCI but researchers say here that entering via an artery in the wrist is the best method because it offers fewer complications and shorter hospital stays — which translate into cost savings. The release does a good job of showing cost comparisons, but it’s based on extrapolation of a small percentage (9%) of Medicare patients that underwent PCI using the wrist entrance method. We commend the release for adding extensive end notes about funding sources and financial disclosures. This is what we’d like to see in all news releases. Coronary angioplasty procedures are performed on some 600,000 patients each year, according to the researchers who conducted this study. Finding ways to reduce costs without sacrificing patient outcomes is critical for the American health care system.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9976,"claim":"Acupuncture Might Treat Certain Kind of Lazy Eye","explanation":"This story offered an informative but flawed summary of a study that tested acupuncture to treat a form of “lazy eye” known as anisometropic amblyopia. It was at its best when describing why the trial, despite its positive results, provides only preliminary evidence that acupuncture is an effective treatment for this condition. On the downside, it offered only a vague description of how the researchers assessed the treatment effects in this study, making the discussion of benefits much less meaningful than that provided in the competing coverage from WebMD. The story also failed to completely characterize the costs and availability of acupuncture, and didn’t explain that the research team might have a financial incentive to promote the effectiveness of acupuncture. Amblyopia — a condition which causes reduced vision in one eye because the eye and brain are not communicating properly — is a leading cause of vision impairment in children. Treatment is most successful when the condition is identified and addressed at an early age, but older children can also benefit from patching therapy which forces the weaker eye to work harder and communicate more effectively with the brain. Older children may resist wearing an eye patch, however, and it is possible that using a patch will lead to new problems in the better-functioning eye. This study suggests that acupuncture may be a safe and effective alternative to patching for older children with amblyopia. Now additional research will be needed to confirm whether the benefits of acupuncture are real and sustainable over the long term.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":8964,"claim":"Nucleix Announces Positive Clinical Results for Lung EpiCheck in Early Detection of Lung Cancer","explanation":"This release describes a preliminary study of a new proposed blood test for lung cancer that’s going to be presented at an upcoming scientific meeting. The release frames the test as a potentially useful screening tool for detecting cancer in people who seem otherwise healthy. However, that’s not the population that the researchers studied and reported on — the study results came from individuals known to have (or not have) cancer. The test’s ability to correctly identify cancer in a seemingly healthy population whose cancer status is unknown is an entirely different matter — and one that must be assessed in subsequent studies to determine how useful the test may or may not be for screening. Other concerns include the lack of cost information and no mention of the harms from possible false positives or negatives. While the release seems more targeted to potential investors than the general public we still encourage releases to include relevant information on benefits, potential harms and clear descriptions of the evidence. Lung cancer can be a vicious disease and many advanced cancer patients are given a poor prognosis. Part of the challenge of improving outcomes is earlier detection, so a potential blood test that could screen for the disease would be advantageous. But this work is very preliminary and its difficult to assess its potential value. Readers, particularly lung cancer patients and their families, may derive false hopes from the way the test is pitched in the release.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10300,"claim":"New drug promising against cholesterol","explanation":"If things go well with future experiments and clinical use, we may someday look back on this trial as a turning point for this new class of drugs that affect how our bodies manage cholesterol, but this story takes the corner too fast. The results of the trial of anacetrapib give researchers confidence that they can safely proceed to the next round of testing without exposing patients to the life-threatening side effects caused by a similar drug, torcetrapib. However, this story (which misspells the drug’s name throughout the online version) emphasizes potential, but uNPRoven, health effects. There is good material in the story, including several cautionary statements (deep in the story) about how anacetrapib has yet to demonstrate it can save lives or reduce disease. It also reports that the trial was sponsored by the company developing the drug, though it fails to point out the financial ties of the researcher that is quoted. Trials can demonstrate only what they are designed to investigate. This trial was designed to rule out major safety problems and document changes in cholesterol levels in people. It was not designed to produce evidence that this method of altering cholesterol levels translates into health benefits. The next round of trials should provide answers to important questions about health outcomes, but readers of this story may not understand that this trial did not. Over 20 million Americans currently take statin drugs. Anacetrapib works on cholesterol in a different way, by inhibiting a protein called CETP (cholesterol ester transfer protein). These drugs also offer hope to drug companies that are losing patent protection on the leading brands of statins. That marketing angle means journalists need to be vigilant about claims of benefits. The early tests of an earlier CETP inhibitor, torcetrapib, also indicated powerful effects on cholesterol, especially in raising levels of the “good” HDL form. However, as this story notes, larger trials then discovered dangerous side effects. It turned out that drug actually caused more heart problems than it prevented. In reality it takes a lot of subjects to even begin to get a picture of the risks and benefits of a new drug. While encouraging, the results of this study are far from conclusive.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9051,"claim":"High doses of vitamin D rapidly reduce arterial stiffness","explanation":"Getty Images With just a few tweaks, this could have been a stellar release on a small study about the benefits of high doses of vitamin D on arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness is a cause of atherosclerosis, a  thickening and stiffening of the arterial wall, and is related to high blood pressure or hypertension. The release presents many of the necessary caveats, avoids disease mongering and unjustifiable language, and does a nice job describing what the researchers did to reach their conclusions. The release also does readers a service by explaining a relatively complex topic in terms that regular readers (and journalists) can understand. The actual number of people who saw a benefit is missing, though, as is any mention of harms, any mention of other treatments for arterial stiffness, and any mention of how the study was funded or whether there were any conflicts of interest. We gave the release three stars because we felt these were mostly benign omissions. But, in the interest of keeping a high standard for writing strong scientific news releases, we make note of the omissions where they occurred. The benefits of daily supplement vitamins are under more scrutiny than ever because of repeated large scale studies that show minimal if any health effects. This raises the bar for researchers wanting to present a persuasive case for the benefits of vitamin D or any other vitamin.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9439,"claim":"Regular painkillers work as well as opioids for sprains, strains and fractures","explanation":"The news story reports on the findings of a recent study published in JAMA, which evaluated the effectiveness of four painkillers in addressing acute arm or leg pain in emergency room patients. One of the painkillers was a combination of the over-the-counter medications acetaminophen and ibuprofen; the other three painkillers were combinations of acetaminophen and an opioid (oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine). The study found that — within the two-hour window being evaluated — there was no statistical significant difference in the effectiveness of the four drugs, indicating that acetaminophen\/ibuprofen is a viable alternative to opioids for addressing acute pain. The story is exceptionally concise — a news brief rather than a feature — but does a good job of describing the study and placing it in the context of the “opioid crisis” in the U.S. But much like a related news release, which we also reviewed, the story fails to place the findings in context with previous research on the relative efficacy of opioid and non-opioid painkillers. The story does a lot of things well, particularly given its brevity. It describes the study well and makes clear that the study is important because of the ongoing opioid crisis in the United States. As we noted when reviewing a news release on this study, the American Society of Addiction Medicine reports that at least 2 million Americans had an addiction to prescription painkillers in 2015 — and more than 20,000 people died from prescription painkiller overdoses in the same year. And data from the National Institute of Drug Abuse show that this problem is on the rise. However, any story about research findings will be stronger if it explains how new findings are consistent with or differ from previous research in the field. That may be especially true here. If this story aimed to highlight the finding that non-opioid painkillers are comparable in effectiveness to opioid painkillers, it could have mentioned any of several studies (cited in the journal article) that had similar findings in post-surgical settings.","label":"MISLEADING"}

The 18 patients studied all had chronic pain as a consequence of their stroke and did not obtain adequate relief from more traditional approaches. The release includes useful background about the burden of post-stroke pain and the history of research into rTMS as a treatment option. But the study’s small size and lack of control group are key limitations that should have been commented on, but weren’t. We also think that since the device is commercially available and is in widespread use for depression, cost should have mentioned as well as a few words about other treatment options. There are limited effective treatment options for patients with post-stroke pain. This research provides very preliminary evidence that rTMS may also be an option.

{"claim_id":9291,"claim":"Novel imaging technique improves prostate cancer detection","explanation":"This news release is about a new method of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for use in the diagnosis and guiding of treatment for prostate cancer. The release claims that the new technique “measurably improves upon current prostate imaging,”  is “more reliable” than existing techniques, and “provides a better target for biopsies.” No data are provided to support any of these assertions, and the original study that sparked the release included just 27 patients and should be considered highly preliminary. Even the title of that study calls the results merely a “proof of principle.” [Editor’s note: This review was completed in January while we were still developing and honing this news releases review service. Although it’s a few months old, this review contains valuable information for those who write and consume health-related news releases, which is why we’re still publishing it.] Prostate cancer is the leading cause of cancer deaths in men. However, some prostate tumors, even if malignant, may be slow growing and warrant nothing more than watching. If this new MRI method can help identify low-risk tumors, or assess the likelihood that a tumor will spread beyond the prostate, it would be a useful tool for guiding treatment. But the release doesn’t offer any data to show that this technique performs better than existing assessment approaches, and so its ability to justify a role for this new technology in prostate cancer treatment is extremely limited.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":11047,"claim":"For pregnant women with flu, the earlier the better for antiviral treatment","explanation":"This news release focuses on an observational study, published in The Journal of Infectious Diseases which reports that treating pregnant women hospitalized with severe influenza in the early stages of illness with oseltamivir (sold under the brand name Tamiflu) appears to significantly reduce the patient’s time in the hospital. The study also found that pregnant women who were hospitalized with severe flu were less likely to have been vaccinated, compared to women hospitalized with milder flu. The release covers some of the bases when explaining the study and benefits, but neglected to address potential harms that were noted in the published study and to provide needed context on the absolute risk of contracting serious influenza during early pregnancy and absolute rates of risk reductions. Influenza, or “the flu,” is a widespread disease in the United States. The CDC reports that about 40 million people in the U.S. got the flu during the 2014-15 flu season, of which 970,000 required hospitalization. And the health risks associated with flu are significant for pregnant women and their unborn children. As the CDC notes: “Changes in the immune system, heart, and lungs during pregnancy make pregnant women (and women up to two weeks postpartum) more prone to severe illness from flu, as well as to hospitalizations and even death. Pregnant women with flu also have a greater chance for serious problems for their unborn baby, including premature labor and delivery.” The research findings inform treatment and preventative care of an at-risk population — pregnant women — for a widespread and dangerous disease. That deserves our attention. At the same time, we expect experts to inform us about the true nature of the risks to pregnant women and their unborn children. The safety and effectiveness of oseltamivir in treating influenza remains a controversial topic within the medical community. Following an exhaustive review of the oseltamivir clinical trials (which it had to fight for years to obtain), the Cochrane Collaboration along with the British Medical Journal (BMJ) issued a report in 2014 that strongly questioned oseltamivir’s safety and effectiveness in combating influenza. “Initially thought to reduce hospitalisations and serious complications from influenza, the review highlights that Tamiflu is not proven to do this, and it also seems to lead to harmful effects that were not fully reported in the original publications,” wrote Cochrane editor-in-chief Dr. David Tovey, “This shows the importance of ensuring that trial data are transparent and accessible.”","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":10850,"claim":"One-day fight against herpes","explanation":"This story reports on the recent FDA approval of a one-day dose of an antiviral medication, Famvir, for herpes. The story clearly states that this is a new formulation of an existing drug. The story states that the FDA recently approved the new dosing regimen.
