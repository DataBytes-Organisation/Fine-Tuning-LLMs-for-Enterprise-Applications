{"claim_id":9242,"claim":"Cocoa compound linked to some cardiovascular biomarker improvements","explanation":"There have been so many stories about the possible health benefits of cocoa flavanol-derived chocolate over the years and so many studies purporting to document these benefits that it is useful to have a meta-analysis of the available clinical trial evidence. This release is based on a review of 19 randomized controlled trials that studied the effects of cocoa flavanols on biomarkers of heart health. We expected to see a lot of good data in this release but found very little. Instead we found strong statements about the findings being \u201csignificant\u201d or about how the \u201cbenefits they were evident for both women and men.\u201d There were a few caveats sprinkled in too, helpfully. The study authors are quoted saying the review and meta-analysis point to the need for larger, longer clinical trials to judge whether these changes in biomarkers translate into actual improved outcomes for people. And there was an acknowledgment that some of the funding for the work came from one of the world\u2019s biggest chocolate makers. What\u2019s the harm with another story or another news release about chocolate, or cocoa flavanols? There isn\u2019t any \u2014 if the information is balanced and complete. The problem with so much of the information about chocolate is that it\u2019s usually imbalanced and incomplete, superficially shallow, and treating chocolate as a no-brainer superfood. The lack of specificity in this release, for example, would not allow a reporter to know whether this story was worth pursuing. And if reporters did report on this unquestioningly, the general public would not be getting all the information they need.","label":"MISLEADING"}
{"claim_id":11627,"claim":"Studies show that for kids\u2019 ear infections, antibiotics work better than waiting","explanation":"Overall, we reviewed four pieces on this study. All the others (CNN, LA Times, NPR) got four star reviews. We appreciate that journalists sometimes want to bring their own perspective to a story, and we think this can\u00a0provide\u00a0valuable context when the reporter approaches the issue\u00a0carefully. In this blog post about the use of antibiotics to treat\u00a0children\u2019s ear infections, however, the writer prioritizes her own experience and conclusions while\u00a0ignoring important\u00a0evidence and failing to\u00a0seek out the perspective of any real\u00a0expert. And\u00a0so\u00a0the story provides a lopsided and overly simplified account of an issue that demands more balanced coverage and careful\u00a0consideration of benefits\u00a0and harms. Read the CNN blog post for what we think is a fair comparison \u2013 blog to blog, head to head. This blog piece suggests that antibiotics are more effective than placebos for treating middle ear infections in infants and toddlers \u2014 a conclusion supported by\u00a0two new randomized controlled trials reported\u00a0in the respected New England Journal of Medicine. While useful to know, this information isn\u2019t enough\u00a0to tell us\u00a0how all children with ear infections should be treated. To make these kinds of treatment choices, it\u2019s also important\u00a0to consider how much more effective antibiotics are\u00a0than no treatment, and\u00a0we should be aware that\u00a0the benefits might depend on how confident the doctor is in the diagnosis (viral colds and other problems often\u00a0look like ear infections, but won\u2019t benefit from treatment). We also need to weigh the downsides of treatment, which include adverse effects such as diarrhea as well as the potential for increased risk of future\u00a0infections with antibiotic resistant strains of bacteria. After considering all of these factors, different parents may come\u00a0to\u00a0different decisions about whether they want to treat their child immediately with an antiobiotic or reserve treatment for a brief period while waiting to see if he gets better on his\u00a0own. Reporters don\u2019t do parents any favors when they\u00a0encourage\u00a0them to\u00a0make knee jerk\u00a0decisions about\u00a0a child\u2019s care, as this blog did.","label":"false"}
{"claim_id":10834,"claim":"Researchers at Philadelphia conference announce progress toward noninvasive colon cancer test","explanation":"The story suffers from a lack of independent voices and a lack of clear analysis of the data. There was little more than a nod to the potential harms done in over-screening. Detection of a marker for a disease is not the same as preventing a disease or preventing a death. The story says that \u201cvery few people avail themselves of [screening] colonoscopy \u2013 only about 20 percent.\u201d That was one researcher\u2019s estimate \u2013 someone with a vested financial interest in this research. But the fact is that the CDC BRFSS survey estimates that about 60% of US adults are up to date with screening, most with colonoscopy. That is a big difference from 20%, and one has to wonder\u00a0why that was\u00a0not double-checked. Still,\u00a0there clearly are a lot of people being missed. How to improve those numbers is up for debate. Stories about new types of screening need to make clear comparisons between the success rates of colonoscopies now and the possible success rates of these emerging technologies.","label":"false"}

{"claim_id":10071,"claim":"Shots more effective than FluMist in adults","explanation":"First, we acknowledge that the version of the AP story that we found in the Charlotte Observer was less than half the length (327 words) of the AP story as we found it in other newspapers (734 words). So the reporter clearly did a lot more work than what was seen in the Charlotte paper. This is a troubling practice that we've written about elsewhere on the site. Nonetheless, the article accurately summarizes the availability of flu vaccines and the primary results of the new study in the New England Journal of Medicine \u2014 the proportion of children protected from the flu by each of two tested vaccines (i.e. the vaccines\u2019 absolute efficacy). However, the story could provide more information to help readers judge the meaning of these results, the novelty of the \u201cnew\u201d live, inhaled vaccine, its potential harms and costs, the overall quality of the research, potential conflicts among the story\u2019s sources, and other health measures readers can take to prevent the flu. The AP report omits mention of costs\u2014a significant feature of any major public health initiative. It\u2019s unfortunate that the article fails to put the data on vaccine efficacy into a meaningful context. To begin with, the advantage of the killed vaccine shots over the live FluMist vaccine was not statistically significant. But the fact the shots were just as good as the inhaled vaccine was surprising. The researchers note that the main virus they were concerned about (type A) had changed or \u201cdrifted\u201d from the strain that was in the vaccine. Earlier studies had led them to expect that the inactivated vaccine shots would be less effective in this situation. Instead, the shots and nasal spraywere very effective (74% each, according to the new study). The killed virus was also very effective against two strains of type B virus. More information on potential harms might also allay fears associated with live vaccines. Side effects described in the New England Journal of Medicine study were mostly minor\u2013runny nose, headache, cough, and muscle aches among those receiving the live nasal spray vaccine and sore arms among those receiving the shots. The study authors attributed one serious complication to the live (nasal) vaccine\u2014acute pericarditis, or inflammation around the heart and major vessels\u2014a problem that required hospitalization. A little more information about the story\u2019s sources would also help readers assess the new research. The story (as it appeared in the Charlotte paper) quotes a single university-based vaccine expert, but does not state whether he has any potential conflicts of interest. The story fails to note that two researchers received consulting fees from pharmaceutical companies\u2013including MedImmune, which manufactures the FluMist inhaled vaccine in partnership with the researchers\u2019 employer, the University of Michigan. Finally, the AP report misses an opportunity to explain other measures people can take to prevent the flu. In addition to vaccination, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommend several (http:\/\/www.cdc.gov\/flu\/protect\/habits.htm). These include using antiviral drugs and good health habits (e.g. avoid close contact; stay home when sick, cover your mouth and nose; clean your hands; avoid touching your eyes, nose or mouth). It would be unfortunate if readers took away the message that flu prevention is not very effective or that a shot (or snort) has little value for the healthier members of a flu-prone community. What did the reporter put in the longer version of his story that you didn't read in the Charlotte paper? Quotes from two other physician-researchers. Caveats about interpreting the study results. Information from another flu study that appeared in the same issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Information from an editorial in that journal. Information on the age groups approved for use of FluMist. Information on the number of flu deaths (36,000) and hospitalizations (200,000\/yr.) from the flu. In other words, you missed a lot. So this is more of a review of the editing done by the Charlotte newspaper that picked up the story off the wire than it is of the work of the original AP reporter.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9696,"claim":"Newer Blood Pressure Drugs as Good as Older Ones: Study Analysis indicates ACE inhibitors and ARBs are equally effective, researchers say","explanation":"This brief HealthDay story explains the findings of a study by New York researchers comparing two classes of drugs \u2014 angiotensin converting enzyme, or ACE, inhibitors versus newer angiotensin receptor blockers, or ARBs \u2014 used to treat cardiovascular disease. It reports on a meta-analysis of more than 100 studies comparing either drug with a placebo or with each other and finds that both types of medications are equally effective. The only difference being that ARBs tend to produce fewer cases of dry cough as a side effect than do ACE inhibitors. This story is shorter and less nuanced than a competing Washington Post piece, and it relies excessively on a New York University news release. There is more information about the underlying mechanism of these drugs, something probably of less interest to readers, but less about what is new about this study and why it may be important. The story never clarifies what outcomes we\u2019re talking about with this research \u2014 blood pressure, heart attacks, deaths? In addition, the emphasis on the finding of better tolerability does not discuss why this may be \u2013 there\u2019s no\u00a0mention of the greater likelihood of cough and angioedema with ACEIs. Finally, the statement about cost may be somewhat misleading. This story, and another by the Washington Post covering the same study, offer new information concerning\u00a0a debate over the treatment of choice for cardiovascular patients and those at high risk for the disease. Earlier studies had favored the use of ACE inhibitors of ARBs but this new analysis suggests they are comparably effective. If that is the case, it gives patient populations and their physicians additional choices when determining the most effective treatment plan.","label":"MISLEADING"}

{"claim_id":9078,"claim":"Promising New Leprosy Vaccine Moves Into Human Trials","explanation":"The news release focuses on a recently launched phase 1 clinical trial, designed to test whether a potential leprosy vaccine called LepVax is safe enough to move forward into more advanced clinical trials. The release does not address cost, prematurely refers to the vaccine as \u201ca breakthrough,\u201d and does little to discuss potential harms \u2014 other than to note that phase I trials are focused on safety. The release also offers little information about the effectiveness of previous attempts to develop leprosy vaccines, which would have been valuable context. The release is clear about the potential availability of the vaccine, noting that the phase 1 trial could be completed in 2018 and that a decision to proceed with more trials will be made then. The release states, in its very first sentence, that launching this phase 1 clinical trial \u201cmarks a significant step forward in the prevention and treatment of leprosy.\u201d That\u2019s a bold statement, and strong claims require strong evidence. The fact is that, according to FDAReview.org, 25 percent of treatments in phase 1 trials don\u2019t even make it to a phase 2 trial. And, according to a 2016 report from the biotech group BIO, less than 10 percent of treatments that enter phase 1 trials are eventually approved for clinical use (though the success rate rises to 11.9 percent for non-cancer drugs). The problem of overstating the accomplishment of reaching phase 1 trials is compounded by the fact that, while the release mentions previous attempts to vaccinate against leprosy, the release doesn\u2019t mention how effective other leprosy vaccines were (or are). Entering clinical trials is only one milestone on the path to clinical use. What\u2019s more important is how the proposed treatment performs while in those trials.

{"claim_id":9592,"claim":"Kids With Anxiety Disorders \u2018Significantly\u2019 Benefit From Mindfulness Exercises By Changing Brain Activity","explanation":"The story addresses the use of mindfulness-based cognitive therapy as a means of treating anxiety disorders in children, focusing on a recent study of nine children who had been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder and who had a parent with bipolar disorder. The story reports that the study found cognitive therapy was effective at reducing anxiety in study participants. The story does a good job of highlighting that these findings are preliminary, and that additional research is needed to determine how effective cognitive therapy may be as a treatment option for the general population. However, the story does not discuss the extent of the therapy\u2019s benefits in this study, the availability and cost of such cognitive therapy for children, or whether the study participants were also being treated with medications while undergoing cognitive therapy. The story also appears to draw heavily on a news release, and does not incorporate input from independent experts. Anxiety disorders are not uncommon in children. According to the National Institute of Mental Health, approximately 25 percent of 13-18 year olds will experience an anxiety disorder \u2014 and approximately 6 percent of 13-18 year olds will experience a severe anxiety disorder. These disorders may include obsessive-compulsive disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and phobias, among others. A 2010 paper published in the Archives of Pediatrics and Adolescent Medicine Journal notes that pediatric anxiety disorders can cause \u201cconsiderable functional impairment,\u201d impose significant economic costs, adversely affect a child\u2019s education, and increase a child\u2019s risk for adult psychiatric disorders. In other words, pediatric anxiety disorders affect a great many people and can have long-term consequences for both children and their families. Research on new treatment options that can ameliorate the effects of anxiety disorders in children is well worth covering. However, as always, it is important to note both the limitations of new research, and the extent to which potential patients will have access to any treatment options being discussed.

{"claim_id":9511,"claim":"Roche's Pricey New Breast-Cancer Combo Barely Beats Old Drug","explanation":"The latest result\u00a0on Roche\u2019s new combo therapy for breast cancer occurs as a disappointment to investors, though it is one that\u2019s unsurprising to medical researchers. This Bloomberg article receives high marks for reporting the cost, harms and perhaps negligible benefit of the new treatment which combines a newer drug (Perjeta) with an older drug (Herceptin). The story is balanced with its inclusion of the more optimistic side of the news. Roche plans to track the new therapy for years to come to determine if the currently observed small improvement will accentuate over time. This is a notable endeavor since the long-term effect and safety of a cancer treatment is nearly as important as its immediate potency. For more of our analysis on how the news media covered the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) annual meeting where this drug combo and other new research was showcased, see: High drug costs (and stock values) take center stage at final day of ASCO Small studies get big headlines at ASCO 2017 6 things to keep in mind if you read cancer-related news in the next few days \u00a0 The article suggests that though Herceptin has been a potent treatment for women with aggressive HER2-positive breast cancer for decades, apparently one in four women will eventually relapse.

{"claim_id":11389,"claim":"Moderate drinking may help men with high blood pressure","explanation":"\"This \"\"brief\"\" reports on the results of a study looking at alcohol consumption and risk for heart disease among men who have high blood pressure. That moderate alcohol consumption reduces heart disease risk is not a new idea, however recommending it in individuals with high blood pressure is controversial given that excessive alcohol can actually raise blood pressure. This study supports the idea that moderate amounts of alcohol can be just as beneficial to men with hypertenstion as it is for those who do not have high blood pressure. The story adequately describes the strength of the existing evidence and points out some of the limitations, for example, that the results may not be generalizable to a broader population. However, the story should have\u00a0also\u00a0mentioned that any study using self-reported intake of food or drink is always prone to error in how consumption is measured. The story does not quantify the benefits of moderate drinking. The story only provided qualitative descriptions of the benefits.

Unfortunately, it lacks discussion of any rigorous research supporting the clinical utility of such genetic testing, the potential harms patients might experience as a result of genetic testing, or how the specific genetic test discussed in the story differs from others currently in use. As the story notes, the Centers for Disease Control report that about one of every 20 Americans 12 and older cope with depression and some of them (not \u201cmany more,\u201d as the story claims) experience severe side effects from the drugs used to treat depression. Finding the correct drug and the correct dosage for a specific patient can require a sometimes extended process of trial-and-error, with depression sufferers sometimes enduring multiple trials of different drugs before they find one that is effective and has an acceptably low level of negative side effects.

{"claim_id":10624,"claim":"Study: Taking B vitamins can prevent vision loss","explanation":"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a common cause of vision loss in the elderly. There is no cure for AMD and once the vision is lost it cannot be regained. However, there is hope that AMD can be prevented or the rate of loss slowed using vitamin supplementation. This story reports on a new study showing\u00a0 that women who took a specific combination of b-vitamin supplements had a lower risk of developing AMD after 7 years. The story does a good job of describing potential conflicts of interest of the quoted experts, one of whom is not involved in the research or funded by the vitamin manufacturer. The story adequately represents the availability and novelty of the supplements, although it is not clear if this particular combination of vitamins is available and if so, if they are available over the counter or by prescription only. The story quantifies the number of cases of AMD in the vitamin group as well as the control group. The story should have provided a denominator for these numbers so that the reader can get a sense of the size of the risk. The story could have been improved by describing the cost of the vitamins as well as potential harms. While vitamins are generally safe, the FDA does not regulate supplements and therefore there is no guarantee of strength, purity or safety of the product. Furthermore there are some important contraindications and consumers should talk with their doctor before taking the vitamins.","label":"true"}

This segment (and a companion piece aired the day before on autism) reports on clinical application of MRIs and EEGs by a well qualified neurologist. Dr. Fernando Miranda\u2019s clinical work puts him at the forefront of treatment for ADHD and other neurological conditions. But his work is also in some ways ahead of the research, which is inconclusive and still in early stages. He also operates a clinic that sells this service, creating a conflict of interest. The segment\u2019s serious flaw is its failure to put Dr. Miranda\u2019s work in the context of the research, which has been done for over a decade, funded by government agencies and published in top medical journals.

{"claim_id":9051,"claim":"High doses of vitamin D rapidly reduce arterial stiffness","explanation":"Getty Images With just a few tweaks, this could have been a stellar release on a small study about the benefits of high doses of vitamin D on arterial stiffness. Arterial stiffness is a cause of atherosclerosis, a\u00a0 thickening and stiffening of the arterial wall, and is related to high blood pressure or hypertension. The release presents many of the necessary caveats, avoids disease mongering and unjustifiable language, and does a nice job describing what the researchers did to reach their conclusions. The release also does readers a service by explaining a relatively complex topic in terms that regular readers (and journalists) can understand. The actual number of people who saw a benefit is missing, though, as is any mention of harms, any mention of other treatments for arterial stiffness, and any mention of how the study was funded or whether there were any conflicts of interest. We gave the release three stars because we felt these were mostly benign omissions. But, in the interest of keeping a high standard for writing strong scientific news releases, we make note of the omissions where they occurred. The benefits of daily supplement vitamins are under more scrutiny than ever because of repeated large scale studies that show minimal if any health effects.

The headline makes a quantum leap in logic in declaring that statin drugs used to lower cholesterol \u201ccould be valuable addition to breast cancer treatment.\u201d Similarly, the opening paragraph\u00a0states that researchers \u201chave raised the possibility of using statins\u201d to stop breast cancer recurrence. That\u2019s rampant speculation, not supported by the research being reported on, and the story should have clarified this. Offering hope that a potential new discovery could curb recurrence makes for intriguing\u00a0journalism, but if not framed correctly, it is a disservice to breast cancer survivors, especially with such nascent science. More than 2.8 million U.S. women have been diagnosed with breast cancer. After initial treatment, breast cancers that have a large number of estrogen receptors \u2014 which constitute the majority of cases \u2014 can continue to be treated with hormone therapies such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors, which help prevent recurrence by cutting off hormones that feed the cancer cells. But resistance to these drugs remains a problem. About a third of women with estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer experience a recurrence, often more than five years after the initial diagnosis and treatment.

{"claim_id":25648,"claim":"PEDOPHILIA is now LEGAL in CALIFORNIA. Now a 21 year old can have sex with an 11 year old, and not be listed on the sex registry as a sex offender.","explanation":"A flood of social media posts claimed California had \u201clegalized\u201d pedophilia. Some said offenders who had sex with minors as young as 11 would not be placed on the state\u2019s sex offender registry. Those claims are both false. In reality, the California Legislature passed a bill that aims to eliminate automatic sex offender registration mainly for LGBTQ young adults. Instead, a judge would decide whether to register for life those convicted of having voluntary anal or oral sex with a minor and are within 10 years of age of the victim. The bill does not reduce the standards for statutory rape. Existing law allows judges to decide whether to place offenders on the registry in cases involving vaginal intercourse. The bill in question only applies to young people ages 14, 15, 16 or 17 and any offender within a 10 year age range.","label":"false"}
