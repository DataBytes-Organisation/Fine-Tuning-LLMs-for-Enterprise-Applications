In addition, there are several long-acting bronchodilators that can be used for both rapid relief and long-term control of symptoms. For patients with frequent exacerbations, long-acting beta-agonists are recommended. For those with moderate to severe disease, inhaled corticosteroids are recommended. Long-acting beta-agonists combined with inhaled corticosteroids are recommended for patients with frequent exacerbations. A number of nonpharmacologic treatment options are also available.

Provide accurate, concise answers to medical questions based on the following information:\n\nThe use of herbal remedies to treat chronic diseases is widespread. The most common herbal remedies used for chronic diseases are ginseng, ginkgo, St. John's Wort, and garlic. A systematic review of 209 articles on ginseng was published in the British Journal of Clinical Pharmacology (2002; 55: 637-643). The review found that the predominant types of studies were double-blinded, placebo-controlled, randomized trials. The studies were published in 16 different journals, and most of the studies (86%) were conducted in China. Ginseng was shown to be beneficial in the treatment of diabetes, hypertension, and the common cold. The common cold is the most frequently studied disease in the literature. The review found that ginseng has the most evidence supporting its use in the treatment of the common cold. The review found that the most common dose of ginseng used in the studies was 200 mg per day. The review also found that the most common adverse events associated with ginseng were dizziness, headache, nervousness, and insomnia. The review concluded that ginseng is a safe and effective treatment for the common cold. Ginkgo biloba is another popular herbal remedy.

The pharmacologic treatment of fungal infections has been revolutionized by the introduction of azole drugs, namely, itraconazole, ketoconazole, and fluconazole. These agents are effective against a wide range of fungal infections and are well tolerated. They have been found to be effective in the treatment of patients with AIDS. The ketoconazole has been shown to be effective in the treatment of mycoses in patients with AIDS and in patients with chronic granulomatous disease. Fluconazole is active against Candida, Cryptococcus, and Aspergillus. The azole drugs are well absorbed, metabolized, and excreted. Their serum half-lives are approximately 12 hours.

    "generated_answer": "Answer: :Statins are a group of medications used to treat high levels of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), or \"bad\" cholesterol, and to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Statins work by blocking an enzyme (HMG-CoA reductase) that controls the production of cholesterol in the liver. By lowering the production of cholesterol in the liver, statins lower the total amount of cholesterol in the bloodstream.\n\nStatins are the most commonly prescribed medications in the United States, and are used by about 11 percent of the population. Statins are also widely prescribed in other countries, such as Canada, Australia, and the United Kingdom.\n\nStatins are available by prescription and are sold under several brand names. They are among the most widely studied medications and are generally recognized as safe for the majority of patients.\n\nMedical Therapy\n                \nMedical therapy is most often used if surgery does not result in a cure and sometimes to shrink large tumors before surgery. Three medication groups are used to treat acromegaly.\n                \nSomatostatin analogs (SSAs) are the first medication group used to treat acromegaly. They shut off GH production and are effective in lowering GH and IGF-I levels in 50 to 70 percent of patients. SSAs also reduce tumor size in around 0 to 50 percent of patients but only to a modest degree. Several studies have shown that SSAs are safe and effective for long-term treatment and in treating patients with acromegaly caused by nonpituitary tumors. Long-acting SSAs are given by intramuscular injection once a month.\n\nMedications and Chemical Toxins\n                \nSome medications, such as nicotinic acid and certain types of diuretics, anti-seizure drugs, psychiatric drugs, and drugs to treat human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), can impair beta cells or disrupt insulin action.

However, the effects of diet on insulin resistance, a condition that precedes type 2 diabetes, are less well understood. Insulin resistance is characterized by a decreased response of muscle tissue to insulin. Insulin resistance is a risk factor for the development of type 2 diabetes. In a study of 467 men and women aged 55 to 75 years, the researchers found that the insulin resistance index (IR) was lower in men and women who consumed more fruit, vegetables, and fiber. However, the researchers did not find a significant relationship between the consumption of dairy products and the IR.

Provide accurate, concise answers to medical questions.\n\n\nThis study reports on the prevalence of food allergy and the use of epinephrine autoinjectors in the general population of the United States.\n\n\nWe used the National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES), a cross-sectional survey of the U.S. civilian noninstitutionalized population, to determine the prevalence of food allergy and the use of epinephrine autoinjectors in the general population.\n\n\nWe conducted a cross-sectional analysis of NHANES 2005-2008 data, including a random sample of 4,860 adults and children aged 2-18 years. Food allergy was defined as a reported history of an allergic reaction to a food. Epinephrine autoinjectors were considered to be present if participants reported having at least one in the household.\n\n\nThe prevalence of food allergy was 4.8% (95% CI, 4.2-5.5) among adults and 5.3% (95% CI, 4.8-5.8) among children. Food allergy was more common among children than adults (P<0.001). The prevalence of food allergy was higher among adults and children with atopic dermatitis and/or a family history of food allergy (P<0.001). Among adults, the prevalence of food allergy was higher in those who had been diagnosed with asthma (P<0.001) and who had a history of anaphylaxis (P<0.001). Among children, the prevalence of food allergy was higher in those who had been diagnosed with asthma (P<0.001) and who had a history of anaphylaxis (P<0.001). In adults, 53% (95% CI, 49-57) of those with food allergy reported having an epinephrine autoinjector in the household, and 52% (95% CI, 48-56) reported having",

    "question": "What is recommended for preventing mosquito bites?",
    "expected_answer": "Use insect repellent with DEET, cover exposed skin, and use mosquito nets if sleeping in areas with high mosquito activity.",
    "generated_answer": "Answer: 'y' Recommendations: Apply repellents containing DEET, permethrin, picaridin, IR3535, or oil of lemon euphoria. Use clothing to reduce skin exposed to mosquitoes. Reduce time outdoors during peak biting periods. Mosquitoes bite most often around dawn and dusk, but they also bite in the early evening. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Mosquitoes can bite through thin clothing, so spray your clothes with repellent. Mosquitoes also may bite through the seams of your clothing. Wear light-colored clothing. Dark colors absorb more heat and may attract mosquitoes. Mosquitoes rest in shady areas during the day. Apply physical barriers, such as screens and nets, to keep mosquitoes out of your home. Insecticides can be applied to clothing, mosquito nets, and other items to reduce mosquito bites.
