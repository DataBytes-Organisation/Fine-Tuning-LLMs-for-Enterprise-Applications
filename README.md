### **Examples for Each Task in Fine-Tuning Large Language Models for Enterprise Healthcare Applications**  

Below are real-world examples of how each use case could be implemented in a healthcare setting using fine-tuned Large Language Models (LLMs).  

---

### **1. Hallucination Detection in Biomedical QA Systems**  

#### **Example Scenario:**  
A hospital’s AI-powered knowledge assistant is trained to provide clinicians with evidence-based responses to medical inquiries. However, the model hallucinates information, leading to incorrect advice.  

#### **Use Case:**  
A doctor asks the AI:  

**Incorrect (Hallucinated) Response:**  
*"Aspirin is recommended for pregnant women to prevent high blood pressure."*  

**Correct (Fine-Tuned) Response:**  
*"Aspirin use during pregnancy is sometimes recommended at low doses to prevent preeclampsia, but only under a doctor’s supervision. According to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), low-dose aspirin is advised for high-risk patients."*  

#### **How It Works:**  
- The fine-tuned model retrieves clinical guidelines from sources like **PubMed** or the **FDA**.  
- A **confidence score** is assigned, flagging high-risk hallucinations.  
- The system **cross-references trusted sources** before responding.  

---

### **2. Medical Misinformation Detection in LLM Responses**  

#### **Example Scenario:**  
A healthcare chatbot used by patients and medical students provides answers about disease prevention and treatment. Some responses include misleading or false claims.  

#### **Use Case:**  
A patient asks:  
*"Can garlic cure high blood pressure?"*  

**Incorrect (Misinformation from Baseline LLM):**  
*"Yes, garlic can completely cure high blood pressure, so you don’t need medications."*  

**Correct (Fine-Tuned Model Response with Misinformation Detection):**  
*"Garlic may help lower blood pressure slightly due to its allicin content, but it is not a replacement for prescribed medication. Clinical studies suggest that while it can support heart health, patients with hypertension should follow doctor-recommended treatments."*  

#### **How It Works:**  
- The fine-tuned LLM is trained on **HealthFact** and **SciFact** datasets to classify responses as **True, False, or Misleading**.  
- A **Trust Score** is generated, flagging potential misinformation.  
- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** checks the model’s claims against verified sources like **WHO** or **PubMed**.
