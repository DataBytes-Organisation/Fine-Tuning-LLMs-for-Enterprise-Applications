      "input": "\"Item 8.01. Other Events.\n\nOn March 21, 2023, the Company entered into an agreement with its wholly-owned subsidiary, F5, Inc. (F5) to merge F5 with a subsidiary of the Company. The merger is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals from relevant authorities.\n\nThe merger consideration will be paid in cash, with the Company paying F5 stockholders approximately $4.4 billion, or $23.00 per share, in the aggregate. This price represents a premium of approximately 25% to the closing price of F5's common stock on the trading day preceding the announcement of the merger. The merger consideration will be funded with the Company's existing cash reserves, which totaled approximately $8.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Company has sufficient liquidity to fund the merger consideration and does not anticipate the need to raise additional debt or equity financing in connection with the transaction.\n\nIn addition to the merger consideration, the Company will also assume F5's outstanding debt of approximately $1.4 billion, which consists of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% and a weighted average maturity of 7.3 years. The assumption of F5's debt is expected to increase the Company's total debt to approximately $6.5 billion, pro forma for the merger. However, the Company believes that the merger will generate significant cash flow synergies and improve its overall financial profile, enabling it to manage its increased debt burden effectively.\n\nThe merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (HSR Act). The Company has filed the required notifications with the FTC and DOJ and is cooperating with their review of the transaction. While there can be no assurance that the regulatory approvals will be obtained on a timely basis, or at all, the Company believes that the merger will not raise significant competitive concerns and expects to receive the necessary approvals within the anticipated timeframe.\n\nIn connection with the merger, the Company will file a Current Report on Form 8-K, which will include the merger agreement and related exhibits, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The merger agreement will provide additional details about the terms and conditions of the transaction, including the merger consideration, the assumption of F5's debt, and the post-merger organizational structure. The Company will also file with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing the closing of the merger, which will include updated financial information and other relevant details about the transaction.\n\nThe Company expects the merger to generate significant strategic and financial benefits, including enhanced scale and competitiveness, improved operational efficiency, and increased cash flow. The merger is also expected to create opportunities for growth and expansion in new markets and geographies, as well as increased investment in research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support. The Company is committed to ensuring a smooth transition and integration of F5's business and operations, with minimal disruption to customers, employees, and other stakeholders.\"",
