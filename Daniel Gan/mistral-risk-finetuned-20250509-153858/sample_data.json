The merger is expected to be completed in the second quarter of 2023, subject to the satisfaction of customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals from relevant authorities.\n\nThe merger consideration will be paid in cash, with the Company paying F5 stockholders approximately $4.4 billion, or $23.00 per share, in the aggregate. This price represents a premium of approximately 25% to the closing price of F5's common stock on the trading day preceding the announcement of the merger. The merger consideration will be funded with the Company's existing cash reserves, which totaled approximately $8.2 billion as of December 31, 2022. The Company has sufficient liquidity to fund the merger consideration and does not anticipate the need to raise additional debt or equity financing in connection with the transaction.\n\nIn addition to the merger consideration, the Company will also assume F5's outstanding debt of approximately $1.4 billion, which consists of senior notes with a weighted average interest rate of 4.2% and a weighted average maturity of 7.3 years. The assumption of F5's debt is expected to increase the Company's total debt to approximately $6.5 billion, pro forma for the merger. However, the Company believes that the merger will generate significant cash flow synergies and improve its overall financial profile, enabling it to manage its increased debt burden effectively.\n\nThe merger is subject to customary closing conditions, including the receipt of regulatory approvals from the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust Improvements Act (HSR Act). The Company has filed the required notifications with the FTC and DOJ and is cooperating with their review of the transaction. While there can be no assurance that the regulatory approvals will be obtained on a timely basis, or at all, the Company believes that the merger will not raise significant competitive concerns and expects to receive the necessary approvals within the anticipated timeframe.\n\nIn connection with the merger, the Company will file a Current Report on Form 8-K, which will include the merger agreement and related exhibits, with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the SEC). The merger agreement will provide additional details about the terms and conditions of the transaction, including the merger consideration, the assumption of F5's debt, and the post-merger organizational structure. The Company will also file with the SEC a Current Report on Form 8-K announcing the closing of the merger, which will include updated financial information and other relevant details about the transaction.\n\nThe Company expects the merger to generate significant strategic and financial benefits, including enhanced scale and competitiveness, improved operational efficiency, and increased cash flow. The merger is also expected to create opportunities for growth and expansion in new markets and geographies, as well as increased investment in research and development, sales and marketing, and customer support. The Company is committed to ensuring a smooth transition and integration of F5's business and operations, with minimal disruption to customers, employees, and other stakeholders.\"",

This potential negative impact may be exacerbated by various factors, including, but not limited to, reduced investor confidence, increased volatility in the financial markets, and reduced access to capital.\n\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has had a significant impact on the global economy, including the Company\u2019s customers, and the Company has experienced and may continue to experience significant disruptions to its global operations. These disruptions include, but are not limited to, supply chain disruptions, the inability to access certain of its facilities, including the inability to access the Company\u2019s global headquarters, as well as to its customers and suppliers, including the inability to access the Company\u2019s customers\u2019 facilities. This has resulted in and may continue to result in significant disruptions to the Company\u2019s ability to supply products to its customers, potentially leading to delays, cancellations, or reductions in orders.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in and may continue to result in significant disruptions to the Company\u2019s supply chain. These disruptions include, but are not limited to, the Company\u2019s inability to obtain adequate supplies of certain raw materials and components, including, but not limited to, semiconductors. The pandemic has caused significant shortages of these critical components, leading to increased costs and reduced availability. Furthermore, the Company\u2019s inability to obtain adequate supplies of certain manufacturing and production materials and supplies, including, but not limited to, manufacturing equipment and tooling, has resulted in and may continue to result in significant disruptions to the Company\u2019s ability to supply products to its customers.\n\nIn addition, the COVID-19 pandemic has resulted in and may continue to result in significant disruptions to the Company\u2019s global operations. These disruptions include, but are not limited to, the inability of the Company\u2019s employees to work at the Company\u2019s facilities, including the inability of the Company\u2019s employees to work at the Company\u2019s global headquarters. This has resulted in and may continue to result in significant disruptions to the Company\u2019s ability to supply products to its customers. The pandemic has also forced the Company to adopt remote work arrangements, which may not be as effective as traditional in-person work arrangements, potentially leading to reduced productivity and efficiency.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic has also resulted in and may continue to result in significant disruptions to the Company\u2019s ability to deliver products to its customers. These disruptions include, but are not limited to, the Company\u2019s inability to deliver products to its customers in a timely manner. This has resulted in and may continue to result in significant delays, increased costs, and reduced customer satisfaction. Furthermore, the pandemic has caused significant disruptions to global logistics and transportation systems, leading to increased costs and reduced availability of shipping and delivery options.\n\nThe Company is actively working to mitigate the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic on its global operations and supply chain. These efforts include, but are not limited to, implementing remote work arrangements, increasing inventory levels of critical components, and identifying alternative suppliers and logistics providers. However, the Company cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful, and the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s ability to supply products to its customers.\n\nThe Company\u2019s management is closely monitoring the situation and is taking all necessary steps to minimize the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on the Company\u2019s operations and financial performance. However, the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact the Company\u2019s financial performance and operations will depend on various factors, including, but not limited to, the duration and severity of the pandemic, the impact of the pandemic on the global economy, and the effectiveness of the Company\u2019s mitigation efforts. As a result, the Company cannot provide any assurance that the COVID-19 pandemic will not have a material adverse impact on its financial performance and operations.\n\nIn light of the significant uncertainties and risks associated with the COVID-19 pandemic, the Company is taking a cautious approach to its financial planning and budgeting. The Company is regularly reviewing and updating its financial projections and is prepared to take additional steps as necessary to mitigate the impacts of the pandemic on its financial performance and operations. However, the Company cannot guarantee that these efforts will be successful, and the COVID-19 pandemic may continue to have a significant impact on the Company\u2019s financial performance and operations.\n\nThe Company will continue to closely monitor the situation and will provide updates as necessary. However, the Company cannot predict with certainty the extent to which the COVID-19 pandemic will impact its financial performance and operations, and the Company\u2019s actual results may differ significantly from its current expectations.\"",

As of December 31, 2022, the Company's total debt outstanding was $1.2 billion, consisting of $800 million in senior notes and $400 million in term loans. The Company\u2019s level of indebtedness may have significant consequences, including:\n\n\u2022 making it more difficult for the Company to raise capital to fund its business, pay its debts, or meet working capital needs. The Company may be required to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to service its debt, which could limit its ability to invest in its business, respond to changes in the market, or take advantage of new opportunities;\n\n\u2022 increasing sensitivity to changes in interest rates and other market conditions, including the Company\u2019s exposure to variable rate debt. As of December 31, 2022, approximately $600 million of the Company's debt was subject to variable interest rates, which could result in increased interest expenses if interest rates rise;\n\n\u2022 making it more difficult for the Company to comply with financial covenants, including those related to leverage, interest coverage, and other financial ratios, contained in the Company\u2019s debt agreements. The Company is required to maintain certain financial ratios, such as a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 3.5:1 and an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.5:1, and failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under its debt agreements;\n\n\u2022 subjecting the Company to the risk of default under its debt agreements, which could result in the acceleration of its debt. If the Company defaults under any of its debt agreements, the lenders may declare all outstanding debt to be immediately due and payable, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations;\n\n\u2022 subjecting the Company to the risk of cross-default, which could result in the acceleration of the Company\u2019s debt, including the senior notes and the term loan, if the Company defaults under any other agreement. The Company has various other agreements, such as lease agreements and supply contracts, that contain cross-default provisions, which could result in a default under its debt agreements if the Company defaults under any of these other agreements;\n\n\u2022 subjecting the Company to the risk of restrictions on its ability to make payments on its debt, including the senior notes and the term loan, or make certain investments or enter into certain transactions. The Company's debt agreements contain various restrictions, such as limitations on the Company's ability to make dividend payments, incur additional debt, or enter into certain mergers or acquisitions, which could limit the Company's ability to take actions that it believes are in its best interests;\n\n\u2022 increasing the Company\u2019s vulnerability to adverse economic or other changes in the Company\u2019s business. The Company operates in a highly competitive industry and is subject to various economic and market risks, such as changes in consumer demand, fluctuations in raw material prices, and increased competition from new entrants in the market;\n\n\u2022 limiting the Company\u2019s flexibility in planning for, or responding to, changes in the Company\u2019s business or in the market. The Company's debt agreements contain various restrictions that may limit its ability to respond to changes in the market or take advantage of new opportunities, such as limitations on its ability to incur additional debt or make certain investments;\n\n\u2022 placing the Company and its subsidiaries at risk of having the Company\u2019s assets sold to satisfy the Company\u2019s obligations under its debt agreements. If the Company defaults under its debt agreements, the lenders may have the right to foreclose on the Company's assets, which could result in a material loss of value for the Company's shareholders.\n\nThe Company\u2019s ability to meet its debt service obligations depends on its future operating performance and financial position, which are subject to a number of risks, including those discussed in this Item 1A, and to general economic, competitive and other factors beyond the Company\u2019s control. If the Company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from its operations or if it is unable to access capital markets or other financing sources on acceptable terms, it may not be able to meet its debt service obligations.\n\nIn addition, the Company\u2019s debt agreements contain certain restrictions on its ability to incur additional debt, pay dividends, make certain investments, enter into certain transactions, and transfer certain assets, among other restrictions. These restrictions could limit the Company\u2019s ability to take actions that it believes are in its best interests. For example, the Company's debt agreements contain provisions that limit its ability to incur additional debt, including a provision that requires the Company to maintain a debt-to-equity ratio of no more than 3.5:1.\n\nThe Company\u2019s debt agreements also contain certain covenants that may limit the Company\u2019s ability to engage in certain activities that may be in its best interests. For example, the Company's debt agreements contain provisions that limit its ability to make certain investments, such as investments in joint ventures or strategic partnerships, which could limit the Company's ability to grow its business or take advantage of new opportunities.\n\nFurthermore, the Company's debt agreements contain provisions that require it to maintain certain financial ratios, such as an interest coverage ratio of at least 2.5:1, and to comply with certain other financial covenants. Failure to comply with these covenants could result in a default under the Company's debt agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company's financial condition and results of operations.\n\nIn order to mitigate these risks, the Company regularly reviews its debt agreements and assesses its compliance with the various covenants and restrictions contained in these agreements. The Company also regularly reviews its financial position and cash flows to ensure that it has sufficient liquidity to meet its debt service obligations. In addition, the Company has implemented various financial management strategies, such as maintaining a cash reserve and diversifying its revenue streams, to reduce its vulnerability to adverse economic or other changes in its business.\n\nDespite these efforts, the Company's level of indebtedness and the restrictions contained in its debt agreements may still have a material adverse effect on its financial condition and results of operations. The Company's ability to meet its debt service obligations and comply with the covenants and restrictions contained in its debt agreements will depend on its future operating performance and financial position, which are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties.\"",

      "input": "Item 7A. Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk\n\nWe are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates. We manage our exposure to interest rate risk through our investment portfolio and borrowings. We use derivatives to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk. We do not engage in speculative trading activities with derivatives. Our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates has not materially increased during the year ended December 31, 2022.\n\nInterest Rate Risk\n\nWe are exposed to interest rate risk due to our investments in marketable securities and borrowings. As of December 31, 2022, our investment portfolio consisted of approximately $2.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.4 billion in commercial paper, and $1.4 billion in marketable securities, with an average yield of 4.5%. Our marketable securities portfolio is comprised of high-quality, short-term investments, including U.S. Treasury securities, U.S. government agency securities, and corporate debt securities. As of December 31, 2022, the average duration of our marketable securities portfolio was 1.4 years, with a range of maturities from a few months to three years.\n\nOur borrowings consisted of approximately $3.3 billion in commercial paper and $1.4 billion in long-term debt, with an average interest rate of 2.6% as of December 31, 2022. Our commercial paper is used to finance our working capital needs, while our long-term debt is used to finance our strategic initiatives and capital expenditures. We have a well-diversified debt portfolio with a range of maturities from a few months to 10 years.\n\nTo quantify the potential impact of changes in interest rates on our investment portfolio and borrowings, we performed a sensitivity analysis as of December 31, 2022. A 10% increase in interest rates would result in a loss of approximately $1.4 million for our investments in marketable securities and a gain of approximately $5.6 million for our borrowings, with an average duration of 1.4 years. A 10% decrease in interest rates would result in a gain of approximately $1.4 million for our investments in marketable securities and a loss of approximately $5.6 million for our borrowings, with an average duration of 1.4 years. These estimates are based on the assumption that the interest rate changes are instantaneous and that the interest rates remain constant over the duration of the investments and borrowings.\n\nForeign Currency Exchange Rate Risk\n\nWe are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk due to our sales and purchases of products and services in foreign currencies. We also have investments in and borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. We use derivatives to manage our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our derivatives are primarily in the form of forward contracts and option contracts, which are used to hedge our foreign currency exposures. As of December 31, 2022, our foreign currency exposure consisted of approximately $1.4 billion in cash and cash equivalents, $1.1 billion in commercial paper, and $1.1 billion in long-term debt, with an average foreign currency exchange rate of 1.00.\n\nA 10% change in the value of the U.S. dollar relative to the foreign currencies in which we operate would result in a gain or loss of approximately $1.4 billion, $1.1 billion, and $1.1 billion, respectively, for our cash and cash equivalents, commercial paper, and long-term debt. These estimates are based on the assumption that the foreign currency exchange rate changes are instantaneous and that the exchange rates remain constant over the duration of the investments and borrowings.\n\nTo further mitigate our foreign currency exchange rate risk, we have implemented a hedging program that uses derivatives to hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures. As of December 31, 2022, we had outstanding derivatives with a notional value of approximately $1.2 billion, which were used to hedge our foreign currency exposures. These derivatives are primarily in the form of forward contracts and option contracts, which are used to hedge our foreign currency exposures.\n\nIn addition to our hedging program, we also manage our foreign currency exchange rate risk through our operating activities. We have a diversified revenue base, with sales in multiple countries and regions, which helps to reduce our exposure to any one particular currency. We also have a significant portion of our costs denominated in the same currency as our revenues, which helps to further reduce our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk.\n\nOverall, we believe that our exposure to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates is manageable, and we have implemented various strategies to mitigate these risks. We will continue to monitor our exposure to market risk and adjust our strategies as necessary to ensure that our financial performance is not materially impacted by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nAs part of our ongoing risk management process, we regularly review our investment portfolio and borrowings to ensure that they remain aligned with our risk management objectives. We also regularly review our hedging program to ensure that it remains effective in managing our foreign currency exchange rate risk. We believe that our risk management strategies have been effective in managing our exposure to market risk, and we will continue to monitor and adjust these strategies as necessary to ensure that our financial performance is not materially impacted by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.\n\nIn conclusion, we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, but we have implemented various strategies to mitigate these risks. We believe that our exposure to market risk is manageable, and we will continue to monitor and adjust our risk management strategies as necessary to ensure that our financial performance is not materially impacted by changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates.",

      "input": "\"of $5.0 billion in 2022, $5.2 billion in 2021, and $5.1 billion in 2020. As of December 31, 2022, $4.3 billion of the $5.0 billion of 2022 notes remained outstanding. The notes that were repaid in 2022 were settled primarily through cash payments, with a minor portion being exchanged for other debt instruments with more favorable terms.\n\nWe also issue commercial paper, which is generally used to finance our short-term working capital requirements. We have issued commercial paper of up to $10.0 billion in aggregate principal amount. As of December 31, 2022, $5.6 billion of commercial paper was outstanding. This commercial paper is primarily used to fund our operational needs, such as inventory and accounts receivable, and we generally repay these borrowings within a short period, typically within 90 days. The interest rates on our commercial paper are determined by market conditions and our credit rating, and we closely monitor our commercial paper borrowings to minimize the costs of these financings.\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, we had $13.2 billion of cash and cash equivalents, including $2.3 billion of cash held in foreign subsidiaries. The cash held in foreign subsidiaries is generally used to fund our international operations and is subject to certain repatriation restrictions and foreign withholding taxes. We also had $12.3 billion of unused borrowing capacity under our credit facilities, which provides us with additional liquidity to meet our financial obligations as needed. We believe our liquidity, including our cash and cash equivalents and unused borrowing capacity, is sufficient to meet our current and projected short-term and long-term financial obligations. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient liquidity in the future to meet our long-term financial obligations or that our financial obligations will not exceed our cash and cash equivalents or our available borrowing capacity.\n\nOur cash flows from operating activities are influenced by a number of factors, including our operating performance, the timing of capital expenditures, and the level of borrowings and repayments under our credit facilities. We generate cash from the sale of our products and services, and our primary use of cash is to fund our operations and make capital expenditures. We use cash generated from our operations to fund our capital expenditures, including the acquisition of property, plant, and equipment, and to pay dividends to our shareholders. We also use cash generated from our operations to fund our research and development activities, which are critical to our long-term growth and competitiveness.\n\nIn 2022, our cash flows from operating activities were $10.5 billion, which was primarily driven by our net income of $8.5 billion and non-cash items such as depreciation and amortization of $2.2 billion. We also generated $1.3 billion of cash from the sale of certain assets and businesses, which was partially offset by $0.5 billion of cash used for acquisitions. Our capital expenditures in 2022 were $3.5 billion, which was primarily focused on investing in our manufacturing capabilities and technology infrastructure.\n\nWe expect our cash flows from operating activities to continue to be influenced by a number of factors, including the timing of capital expenditures, the level of borrowings and repayments under our credit facilities, and the level of our cash dividends to shareholders. Our ability to generate cash from our operations is influenced by a number of factors, including the level of demand for our products and services, the level of our operating income, and the level of our capital expenditures. We closely monitor our cash flows and adjust our capital expenditures and dividend payments as needed to ensure that we maintain a strong liquidity position.\n\nWe believe that our cash flows from operating activities will continue to be sufficient to meet our current and projected financial obligations for the next twelve months. However, we cannot provide assurance that we will have sufficient cash flows from operating activities in the future to meet our financial obligations or that our financial obligations will not exceed our cash flows from operating activities. We regularly review our cash flows and liquidity position to ensure that we have sufficient funds to meet our financial obligations and to invest in our business to drive long-term growth.\n\nIn addition to our cash flows from operating activities, we also have access to various sources of financing, including our credit facilities and the debt capital markets. We have a long-term debt rating of A- from Standard & Poor's and A3 from Moody's, which provides us with access to the debt capital markets at favorable interest rates. We closely monitor our credit ratings and take steps to maintain a strong credit profile, which is critical to our ability to access the debt capital markets and to maintain our liquidity position.\n\nOverall, we believe that our strong liquidity position, combined with our ability to generate cash from our operations and access to various sources of financing, will enable us to meet our current and projected financial obligations and to invest in our business to drive long-term growth.\"",

      "input": "Accounting Standards Adopted in 2023, 2022, and the Cumulative Effect of the Adoption of New Standards in 2022\n\nThe Company adopted several new accounting standards issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) in 2023 and 2022. The cumulative effect of the adoption of the new standard in 2022 was recognized in retained earnings in 2022. As discussed below, the adoption of these standards did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements.\n\nAdoption of ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers\n\nThe Company adopted the guidance in ASC Topic 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, as of January 1, 2018. The core principle of this standard is that an entity recognizes revenue to depict the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, as the Company's revenue recognition policies were already largely aligned with the new standard.\n\nAdoption of ASC Topic 842, Leases\n\nThe Company adopted the guidance in ASC Topic 842, Leases, as of January 1, 2022. This standard requires lessees to recognize a right-of-use asset and a lease liability for all leases with terms longer than 12 months. The adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of $1.4 billion of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, as well as an increase in other assets and liabilities of $0.3 billion. The Company has elected to apply the optional transition method, which allows the Company to continue to apply the existing lease guidance for all leases that commenced before the effective date. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, as the impact was primarily related to the recognition of right-of-use assets and lease liabilities, which did not affect the Company's net income.\n\nAdoption of ASC Topic 321, Investments in Equity Securities\n\nThe Company adopted the guidance in ASC Topic 321, Investments in Equity Securities, as of January 1, 2023. This standard provides guidance on the accounting for investments in equity securities and requires entities to measure certain investments in equity securities at fair value with changes in fair value recognized in net income. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, as the Company's investments in equity securities are not significant.\n\nAdoption of ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging\n\nThe Company adopted the guidance in ASC Topic 815, Derivatives and Hedging, as of January 1, 2023. This standard provides guidance on the accounting for derivatives and hedging activities. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, as the Company's derivative and hedging activities are not significant.\n\nAdoption of ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income\n\nThe Company adopted the guidance in ASC Topic 220, Comprehensive Income, as of January 1, 2023. This standard provides guidance on the accounting for comprehensive income, which includes all changes in equity other than transactions with shareholders. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, as the Company's comprehensive income is not significant.\n\nAdoption of ASC Topic 330, Earnings Per Share\n\nThe Company adopted the guidance in ASC Topic 330, Earnings Per Share, as of January 1, 2023. This standard provides guidance on the accounting for earnings per share. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, as the Company's earnings per share calculation is not affected by the new standard.\n\nAdoption of ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment\n\nThe Company adopted the guidance in ASC Topic 360, Property, Plant, and Equipment, as of January 1, 2023. This standard provides guidance on the accounting for property, plant, and equipment, including the recognition of impairment losses. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, as the Company's property, plant, and equipment are not significant.\n\nAdoption of ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other\n\nThe Company adopted the guidance in ASC Topic 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other, as of January 1, 2023. This standard provides guidance on the accounting for intangible assets, including goodwill and other intangible assets. The adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements, as the Company's intangible assets are not significant.\n\nIn conclusion, the adoption of the new accounting standards in 2023 and 2022 did not have a material impact on the Company's consolidated financial statements. The Company will continue to monitor the impact of these standards on its financial statements and will provide updates as necessary.",

Risk Factors, the Company's acquisition strategy involves inherent risks, including the risks associated with the acquisition of companies, such as the risks associated with the acquisition of LTI. These risks include, but are not limited to, the following:\n\n*   The difficulty in integrating the operations and personnel of the acquired company;\n*   The potential disruption of the Company's ongoing business and operations;\n*   The risk of unknown or contingent liabilities;\n*   The potential for impairment of goodwill or other intangible assets;\n*   The risk of loss of key employees or customers;\n*   The potential for unanticipated costs or expenses;\n*   The risk of non-compliance with applicable laws and regulations; and\n*   The potential for disputes or litigation with the acquired company's former owners or other third parties.\n\nThe Company believes that the acquisition of LTI will provide significant benefits to its business and operations, including the enhancement of its offerings and capabilities.
